Tuesday July 7th, I was invited to participate in a round table at the "<a href="http://kingsconference.com/healthcare.html" target="_blank">Annual Networking Conference on Healthcare Efficiency through Technology: BIG DATA and Clinical Genomics</a>" event.

It was a pleasure and an honor to share the stage and discuss the state of Clinical Genomics with speakers as distinguished as Prof. Tim Hubbard, Head of Bioinformatics (Genomics England); Dr Johnny Marshall, Director of Policy (NHS Confederation); or my friend Dr. Craig Parman, Life Sciences Director (Hitachi), and many more.
