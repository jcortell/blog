Excuse to try a new photo plug-in for WP:

First photo: the Chrysler building as seen from my living room window.

Second photo: same thing on a foggy day&#8230; Building gone! (no Image Editing here).

Third photo: the Empire State Building, from the living room, decorated with &#8220;Spanish flags colors&#8221;
