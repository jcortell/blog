Kanteron Systems was selected as finalist, along with British Telecom and nusys, in the IBM Innovation Awards, New Business Model category, for the Split and Pathology Imaging Algorithms solutions. So I went with Juan to attend the <a title="http://www-05.ibm.com/es/cnbp2015/" href="http://www-05.ibm.com/es/cnbp2015/" target="_blank">IBM Leadership Summit</a> that took place at the Royal Spanish Academy in Madrid (Spain), March 3rd, 2015.

Good Spanish ham, lots of back patting, and the same "good-old-boys" (upper-class white males in their fifties) running the same show with the latest buzzwords and spiffy marketing.
