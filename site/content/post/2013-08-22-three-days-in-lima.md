On Tuesday August 13th (in case you did not notice, I am obviously not superstitious at all), I took a &#8220;red-eye&#8221; (so called because you arrive with red eyes) flight to Lima, Peru. Note to self number one: do not take one of the &#8220;official&#8221; taxis with a desk before the exit of the controlled area of the airport. $46 for a ride to downtown is a steal, no matter how luxurious and comfortable the car.

Although I was treated like a VIP at the <a title="http://www.radisson.com/miraflores-hotel-pe-lima18/peflores" href="http://www.radisson.com/miraflores-hotel-pe-lima18/peflores" target="_blank">hotel</a>, thanks to my wonderful @Cruise_Curator travel agent, the room was not yet ready when I arrived around 7am. So I showered and changed at the gym, and went straight to my first business presentation. As a curious anecdote, I ran, for the second time in a trip, into another Spanish executive of a Spanish (albeit US owned) healthcare tech company. 

I spent three intense days working, working, and working. I met executives from some of the largest hospitals and networks in the country. I presented, along with IBM, the latest in healthcare technology at an event at the <a title="http://www.hotelcountry.com/default-en.html" href="http://www.hotelcountry.com/default-en.html" target="_blank">Country Club Hotel</a>. And when I had a few spare minutes, I worked from my hotel room.

The weather, cold and humid, with a constantly covered grey sky (&#8220;donkey belly&#8221;, as they call it in Peru and my friend @Retiario told me) was not too inviting, so I did not engage in my usual &#8220;explore the city&#8221; activity. But I did enjoy some good dining (although not too genuine or interesting, I must admit) with friends at Gaston Acurio&#8217;s latest ventures: <a title="https://www.facebook.com/losbachiche" href="https://www.facebook.com/losbachiche" target="_blank">Los Bachiche</a> and <a title="http://madamtusan.pe/main/1/pe" href="http://madamtusan.pe/main/1/pe" target="_blank">Madam Tusan</a> (his take on Chinese restaurants, or &#8220;Chifas&#8221;). He pretends it is &#8220;fusion&#8221; food. But they are &#8220;just&#8221; decent Italian and Chinese restaurants. Not that bad after all.

Upon my return, in another red-eye flight, and due to a family emergency, I had to catch the next flight to Buffalo without even leaving the airport. Luckily it was all &#8220;just&#8221; a big scare. But at least I got to go to the famous, and deservedly so, supermarket <a title="http://www.wegmans.com" href="http://www.wegmans.com" target="_blank">Wegmans</a> (sorry <a title="http://www.fairwaymarket.com" href="http://www.fairwaymarket.com" target="_blank">Fairways</a>, you are not my favorite in the US any more).
