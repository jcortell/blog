For a few days after Thanksgiving we enjoyed having my parents stay with us in our Chelsea apartment. Visitors are always a great excuse to go to those places that are “too touristy” to go to, even if we like them.

This time we devoted almost a whole day (November 30) to Chinatown, where we enjoyed delicious (and really affordable) dim sum at <a title="http://dimsumgogo.com/" href="http://dimsumgogo.com/" target="_blank">Dim Sum Go Go</a>.

We also had a blast at the “<a title="http://www.allcitystyle.com/" href="http://www.allcitystyle.com/" target="_blank">AllCityStyle</a> toy subway trains for graffiti” display in Grand Central Station, and enjoyed a great lunch at <a title="http://www.davidburkekitchennyc.com/" href="http://www.davidburkekitchennyc.com/" target="_blank">Kitchen by David Burke</a> on our way to the 9/11 Memorial.

Another highlight was to finally try a restaurant that we had really been looking forward to: <a title="http://www.chefsclub.com/new-york/" href="http://www.chefsclub.com/new-york/" target="_blank">Chef’s Club by Food and Wine</a>.

Our friend Daniel manages the place, and he told us all about it. It’s a great concept: the Best New Chefs (according to Food & Wine Magazine) from around the world showcase their favorite dishes in NYC&#8217;s historic Puck Building, in NOLITA. Awesome, right?

So Monday December 1st we went with my parents. The first thing you notice is the art installations from Murray Moss (and the amazing giant Tibetan salt rock suspended from the ceiling).

Here is my wife’s review in some social network:

> Loved it. We were intrigued by the concept of this new restaurant. Food was excellent. Oysters were sublime, halibut was subtle and delish. The chicken was superb- many layers of flavors and very generous with the truffles. Cake of the day was ridiculous &#8211; pumpkin layer cake with homemade toasted marshmallows, almost too good to share. Space is attractive, with cozy booths for 4 but they also have tables facing the open kitchen.

This is a place where you will feel comfortable wether you are looking for sophisticated or cozy ambiance. But the main trick is the food: a menu that will not intimidate anyone, almost “a little boring” and not at all pretentious, but when the food is served you do realize why these are definitely the BEST chefs.

We enjoyed it so much that on Tuesday 9th we went back with some friends. Awesome!
