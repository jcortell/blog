Some people enjoy shopping. Some enjoy the action, other the object, others the fantasy of being able to &#8220;acquire&#8221; that which they feel (or society made them feel) they &#8220;lack&#8221; (beauty, strength, appeal&#8230; whatever).

Last week, while at the SoHo, I found myself enjoying window shopping. The design. Pure art. Beauty.
