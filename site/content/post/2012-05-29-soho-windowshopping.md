Some people enjoy shopping. Some enjoy the action, other the object, others the fantasy of being able to "acquire" that which they feel (or society made them feel) they "lack" (beauty, strength, appeal... whatever).

Last week, while at the SoHo, I found myself enjoying window shopping. The design. Pure art. Beauty.
