<img class="aligncenter" title="Red curtain" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WUaJdZq7E90/UMojBLeDykI/AAAAAAAAIVA/Mii4Jq9AvqY/w738-h551-p-k/IMG_1124.jpg" alt="" width="738" height="551" />

Red dyes sky and &#8220;sea&#8221;, as they call it, as the sun sets over the Rio de la Plata.  
The promenade fills up withÂ Montevideans with their mates. They smile, oblivious to, or despite of, life&#8217;s drama.

This intense red bursts, invades, dyes and covers like a curtain. I must share it with you.  
It&#8217;s ephemeral, I know it will pass, but now it feels as if nothing can escape its spillover, which drags along my attention, my sensibility, my pain, my life.
