Getting up at 4 am and braving the <a title="http://www.boston.com/whitecoatnotes/2012/12/29/flu-hits-massachusetts-unusually-early-and-hard/5KBDMCV8mVMwbFRNqqr9pI/story.html" href="http://www.boston.com/whitecoatnotes/2012/12/29/flu-hits-massachusetts-unusually-early-and-hard/5KBDMCV8mVMwbFRNqqr9pI/story.html" target="_blank">flu</a> <a title="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/48-hours-bostons-massive-flu-outbreak/story?id=18215079" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/48-hours-bostons-massive-flu-outbreak/story?id=18215079" target="_blank">outbreak</a> in Boston and the cold weather including a frozen Charles River (not like it is less cold in NY anyway), I arrived from NY this morning in an early flight, and after checking in at the <a title="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/boscb-boston-marriott-cambridge/" href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/boscb-boston-marriott-cambridge/" target="_blank">Marriot</a>, I went to a luncheon at the <a title="http://towneboston.com/" href="http://towneboston.com/" target="_blank">Towne Stove and Spirits</a> restaurant sponsored by Ken Morse.

The rest of the day has been registering, introductions, organization (with a DJ and nice catering service with sweets, open bar, vegetarian sushi and Middle Eastern food), competition, and team formation. People from 36 countries, fully packed week ahead. MIT, here we go!
