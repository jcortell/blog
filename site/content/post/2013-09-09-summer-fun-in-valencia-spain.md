A couple of weeks ago, we spent 10 days in Valencia (Spain). It was pure summer fun, from the food (including of course noodle paella &#8220;fideu√°&#8221; with crayfish, and classic paella), to the beach and swimming pool (Valencia, Moraira with a million childhood memories of one of the best beaches in the Mediterranean, El Puig&#8230;), we enjoyed non-stop with the kids playing hide and seek, building sand castles, programming videogames, setting up a large screen &#8220;cinema&#8221; to watch cartoons, going to the <a title="http://www.cac.es/museo/" href="http://www.cac.es/museo/" target="_blank">Science Museum</a> and <a title="http://www.cac.es/oceanografic/" href="http://www.cac.es/oceanografic/" target="_blank">Aquarium</a>, and even doing homework.

We also took the opportunity to celebrate our <a title="http://www.theknot.com/wedding/Stephanie-and-Jorge" href="http://www.theknot.com/wedding/Stephanie-and-Jorge" target="_blank">wedding</a> with friends and family (albeit with some notable absences) in the garden of the <a title="http://www.westinvalencia.com/en/Rosmarino_restaurant" href="http://www.westinvalencia.com/en/Rosmarino_restaurant" target="_blank">Rosmarino Restaurant (the Westin)</a>. An intimate and warm evening, were everybody seemed to enjoy, according to their smiles!
