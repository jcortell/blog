As most Valencians will tell you, you have to flee [Fallas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falles)... unless you are "fallero/a" (participating member) or you have visitors in town. Then you brace yourself, and try to enjoy the madness one more year.

This year we were lucky to have a couple of friends visiting: Megan Roberts, a composer and media artist, and Raymond Ghirardo, a sculptor and media artist, [both](http://www.roberts-ghirardo.net) retired art professors from Ithaca College. Of course, we had them meet our good friends Trini and Claudio ([another artist](https://zirotticrea.blogspot.com)), and we had a blast.

To top it off, another friend, Thomas, visited from Australia.

As you can see from the pictures, we showed them as many Fallas and related events as possible.
