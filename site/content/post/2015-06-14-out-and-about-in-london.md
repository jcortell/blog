My parents came to visit from Paris, so we spent a week as “tourist guides”, which is very nice because you discover or re-discover parts of the city that you do not normally go to.

With them we went to

  * Old Spitafields Market (lovely London Tea Exchange)
  * Brick Lane
  * Guildhall
  * Covent Garden Market
  * Museum of the Docklands
  * Southwark Cathedral
  * St. Paul`s Cathedral
  * Royal Courts of Justice
  * Tate Modern
  * Parliament
  * Buckingham Palace
  * Walk along the Thames South Bank

&nbsp;

And ate at:

  * The George
  * Cote
  * The Hornimans
  * 1 Lombard Street (after a meeting at the Royal Society of Medicine)
  * Apero (after a meeting at the Institute of Cancer Research)
  * The Grosvenor Hotel (afternoon tea, after a quick meeting at Victoria Station)

I hope they had as much fun as we did!
