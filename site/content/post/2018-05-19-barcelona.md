We spent last weekend in Barcelona.

<!--more-->

My in-laws came to visit us in Valencia for a couple of weeks, and their return flight departed from Barcelona, so I took them (and my girls) there for the weekend.

We stayed at the very convenient and centrally located [Hotel Condes de Barcelona](https://www.condesdebarcelona.com/). Besides the awesome view to Gaudi's [Casa Batlló](https://www.casabatllo.es/en/) and [Casa Milá](http://www.lapedrera.com/en) from our terrace, my favorite feature was the restarant: [Loidi](https://www.condesdebarcelona.com/en/restaurante-loidi-1/), by Spanish Vasque chef Martín Berasategui, who holds eight stars in total, more than any other Spanish chef. Even my picky-eater daughter approved!

We did not have much time, but we did enjoy a visit to Gaudi's cathedral and masterpiece the [Sagrada Familia](http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/) including the towers, [Park Güell](https://www.parkguell.cat/en/), and the [Tibidabo Amusement Park](https://www.tibidabo.cat/en/home). Curious anecdote: since it's impossible to park your car at the amusement park, and the bus takes a while to get there, my wife decided to kill two birds with one stone, so we toured the [Gran Hotel La Florida](https://www.hotelfloridabarcelona.com/en/) and parked there. Genius.

A very pleasant visit, and a reminder that Barcelona owes almost all its appeal to the genius of [Antoni Gaudí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_Gaud%C3%AD).
