Today, as I headed to work, I exit my apartment, turn the corner onto 5th Ave. and see the film crew of <a title="http://www.cbs.com/shows/person_of_interest" href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/person_of_interest" target="_blank">Person of Interest</a>. It doesn&#8217;t surprise me any more. Am I getting used to living in Manhattan?
