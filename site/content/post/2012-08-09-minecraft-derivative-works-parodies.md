Hugo sends me <a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uA34PovdYw" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uA34PovdYw" target="_blank">this</a> amazing song/video made in Minecraft. Of course, that leads to <a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf7UBjNfXkU" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf7UBjNfXkU" target="_blank">10</a> more, <a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffZEi6ttXaE" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffZEi6ttXaE" target="_blank">14</a> more&#8230; there are so many!

When you make the tools available to the people, and allow them to create (in this case under the safe harbor of &#8220;parody&#8221;) wonderful things happen. It&#8217;s NOT all about the money, profit, control&#8230; It&#8217;s about imagination, art, creativity, culture. That&#8217;s how it happens: copying, re-using, mixing, adjusting, modifying&#8230; that&#8217;s what creativity is really about (or did you think it was about &#8220;inventing&#8221; and &#8220;making unheard of things out of thin air&#8221;?).
