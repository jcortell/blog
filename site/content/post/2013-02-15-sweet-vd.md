When a coconut milk seared wild salmon with basmati rice dinner at home ends with these three desserts/gifts, you know it is sweet:

– I received an incredible Japanese assorted wagashi box from <a title="http://www.kitchoan.com" href="http://www.kitchoan.com" target="_blank">Minamoto Kitchoan</a> (with a beautiful Hokusai "The Great Wave off Kanagawa" Ukiyo-e card)

– I gave her <a title="http://milkbarstore.com/main/stores/" href="http://milkbarstore.com/main/stores/" target="_blank">Momofuku MilkBar</a> assorted cookies (of course, with the "compost" in the assortment) and b`day truffles

– Plus Wholefoods Market Dark Chocolate Pear Almond (Lindt had that flavor, and the discontinued it!, so I did go to Lindt`s store on 5th Avenue and complained)
