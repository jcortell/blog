Last week I went to 3 exhibitions/events that have allowed me to see the importance of context in the interpretation (and enjoyment) of a work of art. Note that I differentiate "interpretation" and "enjoyment", although for many of us, those two concepts go hand in hand. But this is just a short post, so the Phenomenological Aesthetics will have to wait (you can read Dewey, Hartmann, Adorno, Ortega y Gasset, Sartre, etc, etc in the meantime ðŸ˜‰ )

<img class="aligncenter" title="Enrico David" src="https://www.globalgraphica.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/head-gas-enrico-david-new-museum-new-york-city-artists-2012-2.jpg" alt="" width="535" height="400" />

The first one was the opening of <a title="https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/456" href="https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/456" target="_blank">Enrico David`s <em>Head Gas</em></a>. A by-invitation only event, Mr. David talked and tried to explain about his work being shown at New Museum`s small Studio 231. The first impression his work caused was completely **corroborated** by Mr. David`s own futile explanations of his "mostly self-portraits" "during hurricane Irene while on vacation at the Hamptons". But the best explanation I heard of the whole show was by excellent art critic Nebula, standing next to me, who said:

> He tip-toed over his own work

Enough said.

The second wasÂ <a title="https://www.bacnyc.org/events/performances/yjl" href="https://www.bacnyc.org/events/performances/yjl" target="_blank">Young Jean Lee`s Theater Company UNTITLED FEMINIST SHOW</a> N.Y. Premiere at the Baryshnikov Arts Center.

The program explained the very interesting author/director Young Jean Lee`s intentions quite well, and sure enough, full-nudity all show long did not become a point in itself, nor a shock mechanism, but **a statement, part of the discourse, and eventually proof** that feminism is NOT about looks.

An incredible show, one of the most interesting performances I have ever seen on stage, with a powerful while subtle message... one word away from perfection (substitute "feminism" for "womanhood", since they are not the same and most of the performance refers to the latter, and you have a perfect show-description-concept).

While a very interesting in itself, the exhibition`s catalogue was what brought everything into perspective. Cattelan`s work **seems to be devoid of its power and poignant message (criticism or otherwise) whenÂ subtractedÂ from the right context**. Most of his pieces do not want to be moved, and need to remain in their original context, need to be shown where the surroundings add to the message, in order to be fully appreciated. Is that why they decided to hang it allÂ together, as if keeping it away from the walls, from the museum`s frame? Who knows.

In any case, last week, through art, I learned of the power and importance of context.
