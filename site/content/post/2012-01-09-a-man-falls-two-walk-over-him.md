Today, at the gym`s lobby/reception area, a man was sitting waiting for his wife to come out of yoga class. When she does, he gets up to greet her, feels dizzy, and passes out, falling to the ground, and hitting his face on the floor.

Two men who were on their way out, walk over this man. They do not bother-care-ask what`s wrong. They do not offer assistance.

Finally, his wife (who witnessed the whole episode,Â paralyzed in fear) reacts, wakes him up, and makes sure his eye socket bleeding is not too profuse. They leave. Welcome to NY.
