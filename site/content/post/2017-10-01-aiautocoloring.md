Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning researchers are producing amazing tools, and making them easy to use. Here's one example:

The other day I saw an interesting AI code repository to transfer the coloring style of an image onto a sketch.

This is nothing new, as there are many similar examples, like Cloudinary's. But this is open source, and easy to use. Two qualities that I appreciate in software.

So I decided to give it a go with the basic version:

And with the more complex version:

After tinkering with it, I made it work with my own examples. For that, I used my friend Paulina's black and white sketch and one of her colored drawings. Then I sent her the results, to see what she thought of it. She wrote "I'm dancing in my chair" :-)

Here is the amazing result:
