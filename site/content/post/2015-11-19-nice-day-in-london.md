Tuesday was a very nice day in London, which was convenient because I decided to walk to my two appointments, which were quite far apart.

First I met with a PR firm. You know their founders are into art when in the meeting room we were in (one of many) they had a J. Opie and a W. Hewett. Nice. Bonus points.

Then I walked to the Japanese Embassy, where I had been invited to a symposium on big data research for dementia (actually, I chuckled when I thought that, in a way, it could be argued that ‚Äúbig data seems to cause dementia in some vendors‚Äù) üòâ

On my way there I stopped by my favourite Japanese confectionary (Minamoto Kitchoan), and took a few minutes to enjoy Ai Weiwei‚Äôs amazing trees at the Royal Academy (although I will return with my family to fully enjoy the whole exhibition).
