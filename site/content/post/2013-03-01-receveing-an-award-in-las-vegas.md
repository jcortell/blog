From Monday 25 to Wednesday 27 I was in Las Vegas receving an award (IBM 2013 Beacon Award for Best Industry Solution, Healthcare and Life Sciences).

I don`t like Las Vegas, too flashy, too empty, too superficial... but every time I go, I end up with interesting experiences and observations. Like the devastating effect extreme market capitalism can have on the credibility of institutions (Judge Judy`s branded slot machine?? WTF!!).

The event, organized by IBM, took place at the Caesar`s Palace Hotel (I hold quite strong memories from that place, years ago): 2,500 people, busy schedule of work meetings and sessions, a lot of food, a few parties and a concert.

The first day, after my "virgin" flight there with Virgin America, I met with a senior IBM executive, rehearsed the award gala, and had dinner with the "Spaniards" (people from IBM Spain, Indra, El Corte Ingles, etc) at Margarita Ville, with live music, and a giant slide through which a girl slides down to a giant "margarita pitcher".

The second day I had a meeting very early in the morning, then received the award on stage, was interviewed for TV, went to a party with great food and awesome bonbons, at Shadow Bar, and then another one with lots of good looking people (another kind of bonbon), at Pure Nightclub.

The last day I participated in a recorded round table debate with Tim Llewellynn (from New Zealand living in Switzerland) and Aleksandar Vidovic (from Slovenia) about cloud technology and security. It was filmed in a studio set incredibly set up a cafe down to the most minute detail, by a large TV crew, with a director from LA, and organized by the ad agency Ogilvy. Although it lasted for 2 hours, they told us they would bring it down to 2 minutes for TV!

After some more meetings, I went to the private gala reception at the Penthouse Suite (the "Celine Dion Room") of the Forum Tower. Then some Nobu sushi for dinner and a concert by <a title="https://www.trainline.com/" href="https://www.trainline.com/" target="_blank">Train</a>.

A red-eye midnight flight too me back home, tired, exhausted, but happy with the results, the networking, and the experience.
