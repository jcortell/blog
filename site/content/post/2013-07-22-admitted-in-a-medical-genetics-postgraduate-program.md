Lately I have been very interested in genetics. I have some ideas about bioinformatics applied to genetics, but I need to learn a bit more. And what do you do when you need to learn more? Study!

Today I learned that I have been admitted in the Medical Genetics postgraduate program (University of Valencia, Spain), 2013.

Here is what I will be learning about:

I. General Concepts of Human Genetics

  * 1.1 Structure of the human genome and gene expression mechanisms
  * 1.2 Patterns of genetic disease transmission

II. Introduction to Medical Genetics

  * 2.1 Genetic diseases. Dysmorphology and teratogenesis
  * 2.2 Identification and clinical management of patients with genetic diseases
  * 2.3 Genetic Counseling
  * 2.4 Cytogenetic Diagnostic Techniques
  * 2.5 Molecular Diagnostic Techniques
  * 2.6 Genomic Diagnostic Techniques
  * 2.7 Identification of new genes responsible for hereditary diseases

III. Clinical Applications of Genetics

  * 3.1 Genetic diagnosis of Mental Retardation
  * 3.2 Neuromuscular Disease Genetic Diagnosis
  * 3.3 Neurosensory diseases Genetic Diagnosis
  * 3.4 Prenatal Genetic Diagnosis
  * 3.5 Non-Invasive Prenatal Diagnosis
  * 3.6 Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis
  * 3.7 Genetics and Reproductive Medicine
  * 3.8 Epigenetic Regulation and Clinical Significance
  * 3.9 Cancer Genetics
  * 3.10 Genetic Diagnosis of Acute Leukemias
  * 3.11 Personalized Medicine and Pharmacogenetics
  * 3.12 Search for treatments for rare genetic diseases
  * 3.13 Tools for updating knowledge in Medical Genetics and Clinical Genetics

The program is taught by <a title="http://www.uv.es/postgradogeneticamedica/profesorado.html" href="http://www.uv.es/postgradogeneticamedica/profesorado.html" target="_blank">29 top professors and researchers</a>, and directed by Prof. Dr. Manuel Pérez Alonso, Dept. of Genetics, Valencia University; and Dr. Javier García Planells, Scientific Director, Genomic Medicine Institute.
