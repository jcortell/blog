Last week I visited the Imperial War Museum of London with my father-in-law and my son.

I am a pacifist, and I believe the military-industrial complex is a very scary and abominable reality. So anything related to military makes me cringe. But I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by this museum. It did not glorify the military, nor it played the over-sensitive card of victim’s suffering. It was detached enough to be “objective”, while human enough to transmit the horrors of war. And the exhibits were very well laid out and informative. Even the store was interesting!

Definitely a museum worth visiting, even (and maybe specially) for pacifists like me.
