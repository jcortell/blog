I have fallen very behind on my posts. I tweet and Google+ some tidbits here and there, but it has been forever since I posted. So, I&#8217;ll try to catch up.

In mid November, I was in Barcelona for the &#8220;<a title="http://www.esade.edu/exed/esp/programas/marketing/Global_Sales1" href="http://www.esade.edu/exed/esp/programas/marketing/Global_Sales1" target="_blank">Global Sales Strategy for Ambitious European Firms</a>&#8221; Program (who chooses those names?). Classes, by <a title="http://www.esade.edu/faculty/ken.morse" href="http://www.esade.edu/faculty/ken.morse" target="_blank">Kenneth P. Morse</a> took part in <a title="http://www.esade.edu/exed" href="http://www.esade.edu/exed" target="_blank">ESADE Business School (Executive Education)</a>.   
Two intense days of learning, thinking, debating, and networking. We even had an &#8220;elevator pitch competition&#8221; which, by the way, I won. I hate being such a good salesman. I really hate it.   
With all that activity, no time to see or do anything else in Barcelona. Although this is a city I have visited many times (I even have family living here), so that&#8217;s OK.
