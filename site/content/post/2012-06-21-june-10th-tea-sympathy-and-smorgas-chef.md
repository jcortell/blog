Two places I tried June 10th in West Village: 

  * <a title="http://www.teaandsympathynewyork.com/home.php" href="http://www.teaandsympathynewyork.com/home.php" target="_blank">Tea & Sympathy</a>: UK _charm_ (irony intended) and Tea+Scones, at high prices, minimum consumption ($11 per person!!), and they don`t even know how to serve tea (full pot, loose leaves... no way to get them out to avoid over infusion of second cup). Avoid.
  * <a title="http://www.smorgas.com/" href="http://www.smorgas.com/" target="_blank">Smörgås Chef</a>: decent Scandinavian restaurant, with their own eco-farm.
