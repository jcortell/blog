Saturday, September 17, was my last day in San Francisco, and the only one I had with some spare time.

After breakfast, I went to but some gifts from Japan Town and then headed to Union Square, for the Korean Day (_Chuseok_) culture festival.

Then I went to the [Yerba Buena Center for the Arts](https://www.ybca.org/) to check out Tom Sachs` _Space Program: Europa_. As I feared, after the failure of _Sony Outsider,_ Tom Sachs` obsession with demonstrating his hand-made "bricolage style" continues. Further more, it feels like yet another bourgeois manboy "fun" exhibition. It is as if the art world is taking a more and more polarized position as if an artist and her work can only fit one of these buckets: escapist detachment from the hardships of everyday life, snobbish detachment from popular accessibility, or rejection of any institution or establishment.

My suspicion that _Space Program: Europa_ was all about the first option was enhanced by the fact that I did not see any African-American person there, although I was there for quite a while. So I decided to test my thesis.

I wanted to go to the [Museum of the African Diaspora](http://www.moadsf.org/), but someone told me it was closed today for a private event (later I found out it closed early, but I could have gotten in), so I went to the nearby [San Francisco Museum of Modern Art](https://www.sfmoma.org/) instead.

The lack of diversity was beyond appalling. It was mesmerizing. In the SF MoMA store everyone was white, many blonde, tall, with perfect teeth... are you kidding me? After reading everywhere about it, and visiting so many tech companies, I knew this city has a diversity and divide problem, but this was ridiculous.

I walked into the museum, and the lack of diversity remained apparent, although diminished by the presence of a healthy number of tourists. Very sad, but it was time to focus my attention on the art.

What a collection! Of course, I enjoyed the usual suspects (Rothko, Calder, Judd, Warhol, Serra, Picasso, Mondrian, Kelly, Martin, Twombly, Sherman, Murata, Duchamp, etc) but I also got to experience some works from Roy Lichtenstein and Gerhard Richter that were not their best known (most certainly I did not know about those pieces), which gave me a completely new appreciation for them, and reminded me that you can`t judge an artist by one piece, just like you can`t judge a book by its cover.

I also enjoyed very much the exhibition "Typeface to Interface", which had it been exhibited in NY it would have been packed with hipsters, but here it was full of techies (interface designers perhaps?). Special mention: the mesmerizing [Sagmeister & Walsh](http://sagmeisterwalsh.com/) video "Now is better":



So with one delightful overdose of art, I headed to the airport to fly back to London.
