In <a title="http://www.deandeluca.com/" href="http://www.deandeluca.com/" target="_blank">Dean & Deluca</a> you can find the most exquisite culinary treats (most from Europe, of course). And while there are so many to choose from a foodie like me could not make his mind up in a hundred years, I must admit the cuteness of this snowman-cake won me over:

<img class="aligncenter" title="Snowman-cake" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I8MWzjFJ1mQ/Tv3vV5NimFI/AAAAAAAAAFE/EZbHza1ORq8/w201-h269-k/20111230_120447.jpg" alt="" width="201" height="268" />On the other hand, even when one sticks to very healthy vegetarian (mostly vegan, sometimes macrobiotic, but always with the exception of sushi) diet, it seems impossible to scape the &#8220;over-spiced&#8221; cooking in the US. What&#8217;s up with everything having to sport a thousand spices, as if food did not taste good by itself? Check out the looooong list of ingredients rom this otherwise organic healthy clam-chowder from <a title="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/" href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/" target="_blank">Wholefoods</a> soup bar:
