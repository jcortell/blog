Banksy is in New York for a month.

With the title &#8220;Better Out than In&#8221;, there is a <a title="http://banksy.co.uk" href="http://banksy.co.uk" target="_blank">blog</a>, unofficial <a title="https://twitter.com/banksyny" href="https://twitter.com/banksyny" target="_blank">twitter account</a> (along with the hashtag #banksyny) since it is not linked in the blog, and <a title="http://instagram.com/banksyny" href="http://instagram.com/banksyny" target="_blank">Instagram</a> (really? Instagram?&#8230; good grief; I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t have FaceBook so I can&#8217;t check if there is also a FB page)&#8230; even a phone number (1 800 6564271) for each piece for which you can call and listen to a great message about (also accessible through the blog). Awesome.</p> 

Whether it is &#8220;really&#8221; Banksy or not, whether there is a &#8220;real&#8221; Banksy or not, I love it.

The crazy news (or perhaps PR stunt)? <a title="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/second-banksy-work-appears-in-new-york-after-first-is-painted-over/?_r=0" href="http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/second-banksy-work-appears-in-new-york-after-first-is-painted-over/?_r=0" target="_blank">The first piece was painted over in just one day</a>.

Here is a piece sprayed on a garage door at 25th street between 10th & 11th avenues, a block from our apartment:

  [UPDATE]
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  I have just walked there and found out that this piece has been tagged over. Welcome to the streets of NY. After all, that&#8217;s what street art is about, right?

  The sad part is the lady that, having placed one of her &#8220;Banksy-like&#8221; pieces there, was selling them in the next corner.

  Again, welcome to the streets of NY.
