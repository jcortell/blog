Banksy is in New York for a month.

With the title "Better Out than In", there is a <a title="https://banksy.co.uk" href="https://banksy.co.uk" target="_blank">blog</a>, unofficial <a title="https://twitter.com/banksyny" href="https://twitter.com/banksyny" target="_blank">twitter account</a> (along with the hashtag #banksyny) since it is not linked in the blog, and <a title="https://instagram.com/banksyny" href="https://instagram.com/banksyny" target="_blank">Instagram</a> (really? Instagram?... good grief; I`m glad I don`t have FaceBook so I can`t check if there is also a FB page)... even a phone number (1 800 6564271) for each piece for which you can call and listen to a great message about (also accessible through the blog). Awesome.</p> 

Whether it is "really" Banksy or not, whether there is a "real" Banksy or not, I love it.

The crazy news (or perhaps PR stunt)? <a title="https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/second-banksy-work-appears-in-new-york-after-first-is-painted-over/?_r=0" href="https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/second-banksy-work-appears-in-new-york-after-first-is-painted-over/?_r=0" target="_blank">The first piece was painted over in just one day</a>.

Here is a piece sprayed on a garage door at 25th street between 10th & 11th avenues, a block from our apartment:

  [UPDATE]
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  I have just walked there and found out that this piece has been tagged over. Welcome to the streets of NY. After all, that`s what street art is about, right?

  The sad part is the lady that, having placed one of her "Banksy-like" pieces there, was selling them in the next corner.

  Again, welcome to the streets of NY.
