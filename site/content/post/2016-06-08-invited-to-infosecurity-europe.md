Today I was invited to attend [InfoSecurity Europe](http://www.infosecurityeurope.com/), Europe&#8217;s largest Information Security industry event.

As always, it was interesting to have a chance to catch up with this rapidly moving field, and a great opportunity to chat with old friends.

Apart from gimmicks (VR everywhere, car racing and helicopter simulators, giant robots, etc), swag (all kinds of Star Wars and other Sci-Fi related giveaways, from toys to t-shirts) and junk food (from candy to icecream to chips, the booths did not have healthy alternatives, although the food vendors did), the most interesting part of these events is always the talks, specifically the hands-on demos.

This time my favorite was a live car-hacking session. It&#8217;s SO easy I feel like&#8230; no, I will not go back to the dark side. But it seemed so much fun I might do it as &#8220;white hat&#8221;!
