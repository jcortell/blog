I am interested in many things. One of the main ones is technology. And within technology, software development to view telemetry data in different ways, within the same application.

Answering NASA’s call to help contribute to the exploration of the solar system, I got access to their next-generation mission control framework being developed at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley being used for mission planning and operations in the lead up to the Resource Prospector mission, and at NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to view data from the Curiosity Rover.

Although I do not have much “spare time”, I have been tinkering with composing and modifying screen layouts, bringing together various telemetry objects and other object types in a single screen, following some basic design principles, as outlined in a book I have read recently: _Designing for Emerging Technologies &#8211; UX for Genomics, Robotics and the IoT_, by Jonathan Follett (Editor) published by O’Reilly.

Still a “work in progress”, but I hope my contributions help.
