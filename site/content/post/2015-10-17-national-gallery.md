It had been quite a long time since I was last at the National Gallery, but Tuesday October 6 I took my family there. While my in-laws were visiting, for my home-schooled son was Art class time. I enjoyed tremendously discussing with him the differences between early and late Renaissance visual art.
  
Even if was only for the proximity to some of the worldâ€™s best museums, living in London is great.
