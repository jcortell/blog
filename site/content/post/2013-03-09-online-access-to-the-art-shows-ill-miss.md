Since this week there are way too many art shows to visit, I&#8217;ll miss some, for sure.

Luckily, these events are getting better and better with their online access and info, and now we have <a title="http://ny.voltashow.com" href="http://ny.voltashow.com" target="_blank">Volta</a>&#8216;s catalogue online:</p> 

We also have a good portion of <a title="http://www.thearmoryshow.com" href="http://www.thearmoryshow.com" target="_blank">Armory</a>&#8216;s show <a title="http://artsy.net/thearmoryshow" href="http://artsy.net/thearmoryshow" target="_blank">online, by Artsy</a>.

Enjoy ðŸ˜‰
