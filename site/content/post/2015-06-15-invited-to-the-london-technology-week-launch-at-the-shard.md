This morning I was invited to the launch of <a href="https://londontechnologyweek.co.uk/" target="_blank">London Technology Week</a>, which was held at The Shard.

Besides your typical mix of VIPs, politicians, and media, the most outstanding thing was the view ðŸ˜‰

You can read the details of the <a href="https://londontechnologyweek.co.uk/2015/06/london-cements-position-tech-capital-europe-launch-london-technology-week/" target="_blank">press release here</a>.

PS.- Some constructive criticism:

  * In an event like this "Technology... whatever" you need a hashtag (something like #LTW15)
  * A Technology Week is full of events, how about a MAP, CALENDAR, or an APP to show them all, and to sign up? If there is one, it`s not easy to find (no mention of it at the event, at least)
