Yesterday we were invited to a triple art opening at the <a title="http://www.madmuseum.org" href="http://www.madmuseum.org" target="_blank">Museum of Art and Design</a> (MAD): 

  * <a title="http://www.madmuseum.org/exhibition/after-museum" href="http://www.madmuseum.org/exhibition/after-museum" target="_blank">After the Museum</a>: "As artists, designers, and corporations have increasingly begun to stage exhibitions, lectures, and workshops modeled from the role of museums in the 20th century, current museum forms are increasingly called into question." (March 12, 2013 to June 9, 2013)
  * <a title="http://www.madmuseum.org/exhibition/wear-it-or-not" href="http://www.madmuseum.org/exhibition/wear-it-or-not" target="_blank">Wear it or Not</a>: The exhibition features nearly 130 works from around the world, recently acquired by the MAD (March 12, 2013 to June 2, 2013)
  * <a title="http://madmuseum.org/exhibition/against-grain" href="http://madmuseum.org/exhibition/against-grain" target="_blank">Against the Grain</a>: Featuring nearly 90 installations, sculptures, furniture, and objects, the exhibition explores some of the most cutting-edge conceptual and technical trends in woodworking today (March 19, 2013 to September 15, 2013)

We also took the opportunity to re-visit "<a title="http://www.madmuseum.org/exhibition/playing-with-fire" href="http://www.madmuseum.org/exhibition/playing-with-fire" target="_blank">Playing with Fire</a>": 50 Years of Contemporary Glass (November 20, 2012 to August 25, 2013).

As an added bonus, a freak snow storm that brought the temperatures back down again.
