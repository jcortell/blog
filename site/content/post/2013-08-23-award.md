I was named the winner of a <a title="http://www.kanteron.com/blog/entrepreneurship/2013/08/jorge-cortell-wins-executive-of-the-year-bronze-award-in-2013-international-business-awards/" href="http://www.kanteron.com/blog/entrepreneurship/2013/08/jorge-cortell-wins-executive-of-the-year-bronze-award-in-2013-international-business-awards/" target="_blank">Bronze Award</a> in the Executive of the Year – Health Products & Services category in the 10th Annual International Business Awards today.

More than 3,300 nominations from organizations of all sizes and in virtually every industry were considered in several categories, including Management Team of the Year, Corporate Social Responsibility Program of the Year, among others. I won (bronze) in the Executive of the Year for Health Products & Services category.

Here is my "official comment": 

> I am proud to receive this top international recognition for the relentless pursuit of a dream: to develop the most innovative open source software solutions for hospitals around the world. I would also like to congratulate the rest of the winners in their respective categories (executives such as McKinsey & Company`s Dominic Barton, Accenture`s Teresa Poggenpohl, PwC`s Ian Powell, or AT&T`s John Donovan)

It`s all a circus. Let`s have fun.
