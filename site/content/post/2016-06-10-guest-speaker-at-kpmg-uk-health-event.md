Yesterday I was invited by <a href="https://home.kpmg.com/uk/en/home/industries/healthcare.html" target="_blank">KPMG UK</a> to be a guest speaker at their Health Get Together event.

It was a pleasure to be invited to participate in their internal event. It gave me an inside look at how consultants work, and I also had a chance to listen to a very interesting internal presentation about their social media use.
