Today we went to the <a href="http://affordableartfair.com/hampstead/" target="_blank">Affordable Art Fair Hampstead</a>. With over 100 galleries, it was a real pleasure. We saw some artists that we like and have seen in quite a few shows before, and discovered many new ones that were quite interesting.

In no particular order, my non-comprehensive list would include many artists, like:

  * Adele Moreau
  * Max Naylor
  * Edvardas Racevicius
  * Andy Wilx, etc

And the whole selection of Galleries like:

  * G2 (Tokyo)
  * Richard Goodall Gallery (Manchester)
  * Galerie STP (Greifswald)
  * Curious Duke Gallery (London)
  * My Life In Art

But without a doubt, for me the true gems were <a href="http://choihj.dothome.co.kr/" target="_blank">Haejung Choi</a> (explore the little squares on her website) and <a href="http://www.mintarts.com/30__odusote-damilola" target="_blank">Damilola Odusote</a>. I believe they have a really bright future ahead of them. It was a pleasure meeting them both in person, for I am seriously considering adding them to the international exhibition I am curating for next year (thanks for the book, Haejung!).
