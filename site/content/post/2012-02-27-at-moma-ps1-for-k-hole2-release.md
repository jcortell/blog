Today I was <a title="http://momaps1.org/calendar/view/338/" href="http://momaps1.org/calendar/view/338/" target="_blank">invited to</a> the MoMA PS1 forÂ <a title="http://khole.net/" href="http://khole.net/" target="_blank">K-HOLE</a>#2 Release. Young people, "Brooklyn artsy", holding beers and beards, with the careless attitude that the PS1 requires: _either I don`t get it or I do, but in any case, it won`t show_.

There were many works on display, too many (and too complex or infuriatingly simple) to comment here. What was definitely not worth mentioning, from my ignorant point of view, was the Alterazioni Video "The New Cinema Event". Let`s say, sadly, it wasn`t even pretentious.

As always, the bookstore interested me as much as the museum itself, including the <a title="http://www.e-flux.com/journals/" href="http://www.e-flux.com/journals/" target="_blank">eFlux</a> trailer coop-bookstore.

At least, on my way there I saw the "Ni Cristo" church (meaning in Spanish "not even Christ" [sic]), and on the way out I was rewarded with a new visual plane on the subway tunnel, for my patience with the 7 line (had to take the E train instead).
