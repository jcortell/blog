On Thursday I went to 319 Scholes to attend the art opening of "<a title="http://319scholes.org/exhibition/collect-the-wwworld-the-artist-as-archivist-in-the-internet-age/" href="http://319scholes.org/exhibition/collect-the-wwworld-the-artist-as-archivist-in-the-internet-age/" target="_blank">Collect the WWWorld: The Artist as Archivist in the Internet Age</a>".

Beyond the anecdotal post/pre hispter crowd, the exhibition itself is a sad celebration of noise. Which, in itself is as valid, or invalid, as any other starting point in the endless debate about art (more so in regards with contemporary, electronic, net, etc).

But it is its legitimization attempt, with <a title="http://collectheworld.linkartcenter.eu/" href="http://collectheworld.linkartcenter.eu/" target="_blank">research project</a>, curator, catalogue, and international tour, which brings the debate to a whole different level. Again, struggling with the Institutional Theory of Art. Again, falling in the trap of the spoon fed.

Again under the false impression that art, time, space, and the like are limited resources. They are not! And they are not because **we, ourselves, our time, our space, our bodies, our mids, are indeed limited, and therefore, when put into context and perspective all those other subjective concepts upon which scarcity we base our interactions on, do become unlimited in the light of our own finitude**.

> So don`t celebrate noise as an abandonment to the vastness of the unreachable. Don`t hide behind noise as a way to escape the unavoidable void. Embrace your own limits and work to expand them. Thrive in uncertainty, certain that the external shall not define you.
