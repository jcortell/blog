Last Tuesday, October 1, I attended a panel at the <a title="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home" href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Home" target="_blank">City University of New York Graduate Center</a>, titled &#8220;<a title="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Public-Programming/Calendar/Detail?id=20738" href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Public-Programming/Calendar/Detail?id=20738" target="_blank">Into Left Field: Progressive Media in the Age of Austerity</a>&#8220;.

The Graduate Center’s Peter Beinart (<a title="https://twitter.com/PeterBeinart" href="https://twitter.com/PeterBeinart" target="_blank">@PeterBeinart</a>), senior political writer for the <a title="http://www.thedailybeast.com" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com" target="_blank">Daily Beast</a>, discussed the health of progressive media with Katha Pollitt (<a title="https://twitter.com/KathaPollitt" href="https://twitter.com/KathaPollitt" target="_blank">@KathaPollitt</a>), longtime columnist for <a title="http://www.thenation.com" href="http://www.thenation.com" target="_blank">The Nation</a>; Joy-Ann Reid (<a title="https://twitter.com/TheReidReport" href="https://twitter.com/TheReidReport" target="_blank">@TheReidReport</a>), managing editor of NBC’s <a title="http://thegrio.com" href="http://thegrio.com" target="_blank">TheGrio.com</a>; and Nermeen Shaikh (<a title="https://twitter.com/nermeendn" href="https://twitter.com/nermeendn" target="_blank">@nermeendn</a>), co-host of <a title="http://www.democracynow.org" href="http://www.democracynow.org" target="_blank">Democracy Now!</a></p> 

While you can view the whole thing in the embedded video, here are some quotes mentioned that caught my attention:

> &#8220;Newspapers are unable, seemingly, to discriminate between a bicycle accident and the collapse of civilisation.&#8221;

George Bernard Shaw

> &#8220;Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one.&#8221;

A. J. Liebling, also author of the quote &#8220;People everywhere confuse what they read in newspapers with news.&#8221;

But the most notable part of the whole debate, from my point of view, came after I asked a seemingly innocent question (1:10:38 in the video):

_What IS &#8220;progressive media&#8221;_?

 Joy-Ann Reid&#8217;s reply, &#8220;one without a giant sponsor&#8221;, is shockingly FAR from what &#8220;<a title="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/progressive" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/progressive" target="_blank">progressive</a>&#8221; media is (it might mean &#8220;independent&#8221; but definitely not necessarily &#8220;progressive&#8221;), and Katha Pollitt&#8217;s &#8220;it&#8217;s about where you stand politically&#8221; gets it somehow wrong too. I liked Nermeen Shaikh&#8217;s answer the best, &#8220;left, independent, critical&#8221;, but still, too shy. 

**The shocking truth? Even the most progressive media in the USA is incredibly conservative**, since they do NOT question representative democracy as a political system, &#8220;news&#8221; is practically reduced to debating White House press releases, and their view of anything outside market capitalism is extremely tangential and limited.
