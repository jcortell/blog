All things must come to an end, and this amazing trip did too. We disembarked in Seward early, following an easy and relaxed procedure, finding our luggage right away, and boarding the transfer service that would drive us to Anchorage for the next three hours. But on the way we made a few ‚Äúlast stops‚Äù where we saw black and brown bears, moose, lynxes, oxen, elks, rain deers, bisons, eagles, owls‚Ä¶

We‚Äôve had the perfect trip. Even the weather was amazingly good. A local woman told us they get four days a year over 70¬∫F, and this year they had two weeks! But that may have a hidden danger in the form of global warming. If anybody has any doubt why we should be careful with the environment, they should come to Alaska (or snorkel in Bora Bora, which is not a bad alternative) üòâ
