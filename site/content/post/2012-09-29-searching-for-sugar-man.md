Last Sunday I went to see <a title="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125608/" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125608/" target="_blank">Searching for Sugar Man</a> <a title="https://filmguide.sundance.org/film/120073/searching_for_sugar_man" href="https://filmguide.sundance.org/film/120073/searching_for_sugar_man" target="_blank">bio/docu/pic</a> at Lincoln Plaza Theaters.

> Two South Africans set out to discover what happened to their unlikely musical hero, the mysterious 1970s rock ‘n` roller, Rodriguez.

While the <a title="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125608/" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125608/" target="_blank">movie</a> is a <a title="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/searching_for_sugar_man/" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/searching_for_sugar_man/" target="_blank">very good one</a>, and the story quite powerful (not only a human story about an incredible <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh-99_1k3mE" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh-99_1k3mE" target="_blank">musician</a> called <a title="https://sugarman.org" href="https://sugarman.org" target="_blank">Rodriguez</a>, better than Bob Dylan if you allow me the heresy), there are two aspects that go well beyond the typical in this kind of documentary:

  * The human quality of an incredible person called <a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodriguez_(musician)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodriguez_(musician)" target="_blank">Sixto Diaz Rodriguez</a>. A zen quality.
  * How completely screwed up the "recording industry" is, and yet how music, art, hope, and determination can really conquer it all. Because whomever thinks it is about the money, should really see this... and cry!

Do yourself a favor: go see it, bring your friends, talk about it, buy the records, go to the concerts...
