After years of trying to get tickets in New York, we finally went to see [Hamilton](https://hamiltonmusical.com/new-york/).

While I was expecting it to be more controversial, edgy, and politically charged with progressive social commentary, I must admit I loved the whole production.

The cast was phenomenal, the music amazing, the well-researched story told with a perfectly choreographed pace... no wonder this show has won so many awards!

If you haven't seen it, at least watch this to enjoy the amazing music/lyrics (sorry for the ads, forced by copyright agreements):
