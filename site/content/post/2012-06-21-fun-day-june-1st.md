Trying to catch up with fun days, here is what June 1st looked like: first some crÃªpesÂ for lunch at <a title="http://vivelacrepe.fr/ing/locations.html" href="http://vivelacrepe.fr/ing/locations.html" target="_blank">Vive La Crepe</a> Union Square (delicious crÃªpesÂ and funny chair backs embedded in concrete).

Then, after browsing around at <a title="http://www.beaconscloset.com/" href="http://www.beaconscloset.com/" target="_blank">Beacon`s Closet</a>, and going to <a title="http://www.tibethouse.us/" href="http://www.tibethouse.us/" target="_blank">Tibet House</a> to gather info (Tuesday`s meditation classes, here I go), it was finally time to visit Rubin Museum of Art. While _Modernist Art from India_, _Illuminated_, and _Casting the Divine_ were very interesting and delightful, I must admit the nerdy geek in me enjoyed _<a title="http://www.rmanyc.org/nav/exhibitions/view/1286" href="http://www.rmanyc.org/nav/exhibitions/view/1286" target="_blank">Hero, Villain, Yeti</a>_ like a real kid. Besides, late opening hours, free admittance, a live DJ, and an awesome store sure did not hurt either ðŸ˜‰

Then, June 2nd, I finally found out what all the fuzz was about at <a title="http://alicesteacup.com/" href="http://alicesteacup.com/" target="_blank">Alice`s Tea Cup</a> (hint: girls playing grownups having tea) in my case, at the Chapter Number 2 location, since I was en route to the <a title="http://www.meetup.com/Spanish-Expats/" href="http://www.meetup.com/Spanish-Expats/" target="_blank">Spanish expats MeetUp</a> at Central Park.
