While I am preparing a loooooong post about technology and privacy (with a provocative twist, for a change ðŸ˜ˆ ), I have decided to play with <a title="http://face.com/" href="http://face.com/" target="_blank">face.com</a>&#8216;s face recognition technology.

What do you think? On target (hint: no, not on target, I am not THAT old, and definitely I AM a male)? Scary (hint: only if we are unaware of these technologies and their uses)?&#8230;
