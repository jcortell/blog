Today I went to one of MoMA`s members-only gallery talks. This one was about their <a title="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1170" href="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1170" target="_blank">current</a> <a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Sherman" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Sherman" target="_blank">Cindy Sherman</a> <a title="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/cindysherman/" href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/cindysherman/" target="_blank">exhibition</a> (great website, by the way).

Rather than rambling on about Cindy Sherman`s interesting work (an obvious reference to identity, stereotypes, social criticism, art depiction, etc, with her easily recognizable periods and themes), on which there are many <a title="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2012/03/05/120305craw_artworld_schjeldahl" href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2012/03/05/120305craw_artworld_schjeldahl" target="_blank">articles</a> these days, here are some anecdotes:

  * Photography is not allowed (I really hate it when museums do not allow photography), so why do they place QRs (particularly when the phone coverage is quite bad)? 
  * Group engagement is very interesting, but when you have such heterogeneous groups, it can be quite absurd to ask questions like "what do these photographs tell you?"
  * The lecturer said "famous" so many times, I got tired of counting. It is quite symptomatic and sad that _fame_ (which means "widely known") is currently used to convey _value_, _interest_, and other more elevated concepts.
