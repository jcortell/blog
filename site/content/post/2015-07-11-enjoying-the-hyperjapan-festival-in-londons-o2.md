Anyone who knows me knows I am crazy about all things Japanese; so since it has been so long that I have been in Japan, I decided to attend the <a href="http://hyperjapan.co.uk/" target="_blank">HyperJapan</a> event taking place in London&#8217;s O2 arena.

It was a blast! Many booths with Japanese merchandise, videogames (with a huge Nintendo area), clothing (like <a href="http://www.aoiclothing.com/gb/" target="_blank">Aoi</a> or the supercool t-shirts of <a href="http://www.askew-wear.com/" target="_blank">Askew Gaming</a>), manga artists, publishers (like <a href="http://www.cri.co.jp/KAORI/" target="_blank">Kaori</a>, or <a href="http://www.kodansha.eu/" target="_blank">Kodansha</a>), bookstores (like <a href="http://jpbooks.co.uk/" target="_blank">JP Books</a>), jewelry (like <a href="http://www.littlemoose.co.uk/" target="_blank">LittleMoose</a> or <a href="http://janenevermore.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Jane Nevermore</a>), designers (like <a href="http://ayakojapanesedesign.tictail.com/product/a4-illustration-by-ayako-01" target="_blank">Ayako Shirata</a>), art galleries (like <a href="http://www.cel-ga.com/" target="_blank">CelGa</a> or <a href="http://www.japanese-gallery.com/" target="_blank">The Japanese Gallery</a>), tourism info and institutions (like <a href="http://www.jpf.org.uk/" target="_blank">Japan Foundation</a>), Japanese schools (like <a href="http://www.alpha.ac.jp/" target="_blank">Alpha</a>), steampunk (like <a href="http://mikie-and-co.com/index.php/en/" target="_blank">Mikie & Co.</a>), and lots and lots of kawaii (even Western-produced like <a href="http://genkigear.co.uk/" target="_blank">GenkiGear</a>, or &#8220;official&#8221;, like <a href="http://charazoo.com/" target="_blank">Charazoo</a>)!!!!!

There was also a nice food court where we had salmon onigiri, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and for dessert we had taiyaki and green tea latte. They even gave us a ton of free samples of <a href="http://www.yushoi.co.uk/" target="_blank">snapea</a> rice sticks!

^_^

PS: As an added bonus, we learned of some cool companies that were not exhibiting but somebody was carrying their cool products, like <a href="http://www.yesasia.com/global/en/home.html" target="_blank">YesAsia</a> or <a href="http://restyle.pl/settings.php?lang=eng" target="_blank">ReStyle</a>.

This is what the _twittersphere_ has to say about the event:
