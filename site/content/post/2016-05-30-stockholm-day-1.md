After the wonderful cruise, we disembarked in Stockholm and took a taxi to our hotel: [the Nobis](http://www.nobishotel.se/en/) . It is a cool design hotel, with a particular claim to history: in their building is where the [Stockholm Syndrome effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome) first happened. It is located in a square where they are installing heated floors!

After storing our luggage in the hotel (too early to checking-in), we went off to explore the city.

We walked past the morning-yogis at Kungsträd-gården, Jakobs Kyrka and the Opera House, crossed the Norrbro bridge (checking out the Parliament House from the other side of the bridge) and entered Gamlastan next to the Royal Palace. We walked the old narrow cobblestone streets passing the Saint George statue, the Nobel Museum, and countless monuments, cafes and stores.

After the nice walk, we went back to the hotel to check-in and take a quick break. Then we left again, passing the National Theater, on our way to [Moderna Museet](http://www.modernamuseet.se/stockholm/en/) where we had a blast with some very well curated exhibitions featuring Kakeis, Selander, Cherri, Kusama, Klee, Judd, Martin, Andre, Tuttle, Flavin, Nauman, Shapiro, Stella, Wilke&#8230; and a high-quality collection of contemporary art, including pieces by Calder, Picasso, Matisse, Tanning, Warhol, Duchamp, Rauschenberg, Oppenheim, Dali&#8230; the bookstore was also quite good.

After the museum, we headed to [City Konditoriet](http://www.citykonditoriet.com/), an adorable cafe housed in the third floor of a very ugly building. Unfortunately, they stopped serving food an hour before their closing time, so we decided to leave and look for a place to have early dinner. We ended up in an amazing (Michelin guide recommended, and featured in the “Where Chefs Eat” book) restaurant: [Rolfs Kök](http://www.rolfskok.se/?lang=en). A great choice! We had a wonderful dinner seating at the bar, watching the chefs work their magic.
  
After dinner, we took advantage of the late closing ours of the [Photography Museum](http://fotografiska.eu/en/), open until 1am, so we walked all the way past Gamlastan well into Södermalm. The long trek was well worth the effort, and we enjoyed several amazing shows, especially Nick Brandt’s &#8216;_Inherit The Dust_&#8216;. We also visited the lively lounge and restaurant upstairs before we headed back to our hotel, totally exhausted but happy.
