Adam Gilfix, Brian de Luna, and Luke Heine, with the help of Dealroom.co, have created a [very interesting data visualization tool for Venture Capital (VC) flows](https://venturecapitalflows.com/eu/).

I know for a fact and from experience that VC activity in places like Silicon Valley, NY, Boston, or London is big. But even when I go back home (Valencia – Spain) for the holidays, there are all kinds of "VC" events, news, meetings, spaces... which, given the conservative and provincial nature of the "Valencian Investors" I have met, surprises me.

So I decided to check out Valencia (Spain) VC flows. Unsurprisingly, those "flows" (both inbound and outbound) are quite recent, very very small, extremely limited in geographical reach, and conservative in industries. See for yourself:

Several caveats, though:

  * The data may not cover ALL VC activity in the region
  * Some activity may be wrongly identified (for example, there is a transaction coming from "Valencia – Venezuela", which could be a coincidence, or most likely a data collection error)
