Adam Gilfix, Brian de Luna, and Luke Heine, with the help of Dealroom.co, have created a [very interesting data visualization tool for Venture Capital (VC) flows](http://venturecapitalflows.com/eu/).

I know for a fact and from experience that VC activity in places like Silicon Valley, NY, Boston, or London is big. But even when I go back home (Valencia &#8211; Spain) for the holidays, there are all kinds of &#8220;VC&#8221; events, news, meetings, spaces&#8230; which, given the conservative and provincial nature of the &#8220;Valencian Investors&#8221; I have met, surprises me.

So I decided to check out Valencia (Spain) VC flows. Unsurprisingly, those &#8220;flows&#8221; (both inbound and outbound) are quite recent, very very small, extremely limited in geographical reach, and conservative in industries. See for yourself:

Several caveats, though:

  * The data may not cover ALL VC activity in the region
  * Some activity may be wrongly identified (for example, there is a transaction coming from &#8220;Valencia &#8211; Venezuela&#8221;, which could be a coincidence, or most likely a data collection error)
