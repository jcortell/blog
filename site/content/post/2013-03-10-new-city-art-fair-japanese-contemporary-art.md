Today we went to <a title="http://newcityartfair.com" href="http://newcityartfair.com" target="_blank">New City</a> art fair, Japanese contemporary art at <a title="http://hpgrpgallery.com" href="http://hpgrpgallery.com" target="_blank">hpgrp Gallery</a> in Chelsea.

Almost everything, from Satoru Tamura`s machines from Tezukayama Gallery (who also carried and showed works by Yayoi Kusama, Tomohiro Kato, and Takao Machiba), to the works at Art-U room (by Kazuo Shiraga, Atsuko Tanaka, Jiro Yoshihara, Sadamasa Motonaga, Chiyu Uemae, and Takesada Matsutani), the ones at hprgp (Hisaharu Motoda and Yuichi Hirako), to Satelites ART LAB (Shingo Iguchi, Ben Mori, and Anna Tsubaki), to Fuko Ueada`s paintings on Gallery Kogure (along with Takahiro Hirabayashi, Hidenori Yamaguchi, Hiroyuki Matsuura, Takahiro Sanda, Yuwa Kato and Takato Yamamoto), to Gallery TEN (who carries Eishi Takaoka, Michio Kono, Jumpei Yamamuro, Masataka Kitamono, and Kazuko Kaneda), to Shusuke Ao`s installation on eitoeiko (who was also showing Shusuke Ao, Ichiro Irie, Yuki Yoshida and Junta Egawa), almost everything was outstanding. Subtle and sensible, elegant and delightful.

Nevertheless, personally I found two artists particularly awesome: Runa Kosogawa`s mindblowing glass work (Gallery TEN) and the spectacularly delicate photographs of Yoi Kawakubo (hpgrp), one of which was obviously chosen to grace the cover of the program.
