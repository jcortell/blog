If I go to the office, I complain that there are too many distractions: whether it is the boom-boom music form the downstairs SoHo store, my coworkers playing ping-pong, street art that requires my attention, or the temptation of a Japanese bento box or mochi with tea&#8230;

But if I stay at home, Calvin makes sure I am not as productive as I could be.

OK, I admit it, this was a very silly excuse to try a new slider plugin with Pinterest non-official API&#8230; and trying those things is not a diversion or distraction, is part of my job, I swear!
