It is quite a privilege to be able to take your son to the British Museum every week for his homeschooling history class. And that’s what we did Friday October 9, but this time I also took my wife and the in-laws.

Visiting a museum on a regular basis allows for much deeper analysis and engagement, gaining on the depth the exhibits have and most tourist don’t have the time to enjoy.

After the visit we went to <a href="https://www.fortnumandmason.com/" target="_blank">Fortnum & Mason</a> to purchase a little gift for a Japanese friend and customer that I will be visiting soon. Every time I go to Fortnum & Mason I wish I lived closer to be able to get my groceries there on a regular basis. After all the Borough Market is great for specialties like cheese and truffles, but not so good for the daily fares.
