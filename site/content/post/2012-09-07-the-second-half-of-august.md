August is over. What did the second half bring?

August 17th, after a lovely walk on the <a title="https://www.thehighline.org" href="https://www.thehighline.org" target="_blank">HighLine</a>, <a title="https://www.lytro.com" href="https://www.lytro.com" target="_blank">Lytro</a> organized a photowalk on the Lower East Side (LES).

August 18th I had a nice talk about Russian art with the former Artistic Director of the <a title="https://veneteater.ee/en" href="https://veneteater.ee/en" target="_blank">State Russian Theater of Estonia</a>, who is now working at the <a title="https://lc.lincolncenter.org" href="https://lc.lincolncenter.org" target="_blank">Lincoln Center</a> in New York.

August 19th morning I had another very interesting conversation with an NYU Philosophy professor regarding learning, engagement... and reality, while having a delicious coconut ice cream. Then, in the evening, another interesting education talk with a History HS teacher, ending the night at the <a title="https://gansevoortparkrooftop.com" href="https://gansevoortparkrooftop.com" target="_blank">Gansevoort Park Rooftop</a>. #OhMyCoolness ðŸ˜‰

August 22nd I went to a nice Cello concert at the <a title="https://www.rmanyc.org" href="https://www.rmanyc.org" target="_blank">Rubin Museum</a> and then some nice tea at <a title="https://www.irvingfarm.com/index.cfm?c=3&s=1&pg=irvingplace.cfm" href="https://www.irvingfarm.com/index.cfm?c=3&s=1&pg=irvingplace.cfm" target="_blank">71 Irving Place</a>.

August 25th was a "triple whammy" of great places: <a title="https://www.teany.com" href="https://www.teany.com" target="_blank">Teany</a> for tea, <a title="https://www.fatcatmusic.org" href="https://www.fatcatmusic.org" target="_blank">FatCat</a> for a fun evening of live jazz and games, and dinner at <a title="https://www.tontonnyc.com" href="https://www.tontonnyc.com" target="_blank">Hakatta Ton Ton</a>.

August 29th I had dinner at <a title="https://redroosterharlem.com" href="https://redroosterharlem.com" target="_blank">Red Rooster</a>, in the Harlem. I love walking around there. At night.

August 31st I went to drawing class at the <a title="https://www.metmuseum.org" href="https://www.metmuseum.org" target="_blank">MET</a>. Although we were supposed to draw the equestrian armored figures, to the right were the Japanese armors, so guess who tilted his chair and drew what he really wanted? ðŸ˜‰

  September, although half of it I will be traveling, seems even more interesting. Let`s go!
