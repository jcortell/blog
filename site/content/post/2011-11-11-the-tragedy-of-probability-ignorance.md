When a M. Phil. from Cambridge, A.B. from Harvard, and M.D. from UCal writes an <a title="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/abinazir/2011/06/15/what-are-chances-you-would-be-born/" href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/abinazir/2011/06/15/what-are-chances-you-would-be-born/" target="_blank">article</a> insisting on a probabilistic fallacy, a trap where, in one way or another, many have fallen (from Eccles to Nagel), and this article is echoed in many sites (such as <a title="http://boingboing.net/2011/11/09/great-moments-in-pedantry-the.html" href="http://boingboing.net/2011/11/09/great-moments-in-pedantry-the.html" target="_blank">BoingBoing</a>) and an <a title="http://visual.ly/what-are-odds" href="http://visual.ly/what-are-odds" target="_blank">infographic</a> is made and becomes staff pick at visual.ly... then you know ignorance is everywhere and very dangerous.

Read the article, then read Roy Weatherford`s "<a title="http://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophical_foundations_of_probability.html?id=B809AAAAIAAJ" href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophical_foundations_of_probability.html?id=B809AAAAIAAJ" target="_blank">Philosophical foundations of probability theory</a>" (or maybe something <a title="http://www.agenarisk.com/resources/probability_puzzles/impossible_events.shtml" href="http://www.agenarisk.com/resources/probability_puzzles/impossible_events.shtml" target="_blank">simpler</a>), and once you grasp the concept of "a priori theories of probability", laugh at those who think each one of us is a miracle... we all are, but not because the probability of us being born is extremely small. On the contrary, it is 100%. Otherwise, we would NOT be here. And not understanding this is not understanding what the most promising scientific discoveries of our age (Theoretical Physics) are based on.

We are a miracle because we believe to be one. Because we choose to be one. Or at least, because we can display such an infinite amount of bold and shameless ignorance ðŸ˜‰
