Meaning to go to a Tibetan restaurant which happened to be closed Memorial Day, we ended up in <a title="http://www.robataya-ny.com" href="http://www.robataya-ny.com" target="_blank">Robataya NY</a> (sister of the great Robatoya Roppongi Hills, Tokyo). Easily one of the finest Japanese restaurants in the city. Cute, fun and delicious.
