Due to my US Visa process (which was soooo long and curious that it requires a separate post), I have been &#8220;stuck&#8221;Â in Ottawa (Canada) for a week.

Sure, Canada would not be one of my priority travel destinations in the winter, particularly if (like me) you can&#8217;t ski or ice skate. But since I am here, let&#8217;s make the best of it: <a title="http://www.gallery.ca/en/" href="http://www.gallery.ca/en/" target="_blank">The National Gallery</a>,Â <a title="http://www.civilization.ca/" href="http://www.civilization.ca/" target="_blank">Museum of Civilizations</a>, <a title="http://www.warmuseum.ca/home/" href="http://www.warmuseum.ca/home/" target="_blank">Museum of War</a>, <a title="http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/celebrate/winterlude" href="http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/celebrate/winterlude" target="_blank">Winterlude</a>, and a few lovely food places (such as <a title="http://www.teastore.ca/" href="http://www.teastore.ca/" target="_blank">The Tea Store</a>, <a title="http://www.yelp.ca/biz/memories-restaurant-ottawa" href="http://www.yelp.ca/biz/memories-restaurant-ottawa" target="_blank">Memories</a>, or <a title="http://www.yelp.ca/biz/oh-so-good-desserts-and-coffee-house-ottawa" href="http://www.yelp.ca/biz/oh-so-good-desserts-and-coffee-house-ottawa" target="_blank">Oh So Good</a>) and a bunch of mediocre ones, while staying in a <a title="http://www.fairmont.com/laurier" href="http://www.fairmont.com/laurier" target="_blank">very nice hotel/castle</a> (with heated indoors pool and gym), will do the trick ðŸ˜‰

Many interesting highlights (see the pictures) like:

  * The frozen gadgets, beaver tail, cold-not-cool DJ-in-a-bubble, and live ice sculpting at the Winterlude festival
  * The Inuit googles and poles at the M. of Civilizations
  * The Enigma machine and piece of Berlin Wall at the M. of War
  * The L. BourgeoisÂ spider at the National Gallery

But looking forward to fly back to NY tomorrow.
