On Thursday , on my way from an event to a meeting, I made two stops. The first one in Forbidden Planet.

Forbidden Planet is a comic store that I enjoyed tremendously while living in New York. While not exactly Tokyo’s Mandarake, Forbidden Planet had enough variety to make it interesting. What I did not know is that they had such a large store in London! It is a fun place full of comic (and non-comic) books, manga, merchandise, figures, posters…

The second stop was at my “oasis” Japan Society, where I go to get delicious Japanese groceries (fresh organic tofu, excellent seafood, mochi, dorayaki, ramen, udon, seaweed, poki, sushi, calpis, etc) and freshly prepared takoyaki and buns.
