On December 4 I was lucky enough to be invited to visit <a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/ai-weiwei" target="_blank">Ai Weiwei&#8217;s exhibition at the Royal Academy</a>.

I knew I would enjoy it since Ai Weiwei is one of my favourite artists. I knew even my son, my wife and my mother-in-law would enjoy it, since Ai Weiwei&#8217;s art is highly figurative and symbolic, even to the point of being obvious with his latest works (which makes its appeal that more far-reaching if slightly less elitist). On top of that, the Royal Academy put together a comprehensive and accessible multimedia guide that offered explanations by the show&#8217;s curator Adrian Locke.

But I was not anticipating to like it so much. It was awesome.

After that, to make the day even better, we stopped at <a href="http://www.kitchoan.co.uk" target="_blank">Minamoto Kitchoan</a> to buy some delicious Japanese wagashi. We got _maccha_ senbei (wafers), _okoicha baumkuchen_ (green roll cake), _dorayaki_, _hakuto mochi_ (peach), and _yuzu_-flavored bunny-shaped _ayashirabe_, but they were out of _chocolat mochi maccha_, and _shimizuhakuto_ jelly (peach jelly). Now we have an excuse to go back soon!
