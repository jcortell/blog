Friday May 17th I took the day to meet some of the interesting tech companies present in New York. <a title="http://mappedinny.com/" href="http://mappedinny.com/" target="_blank">There are over 1,200 tech companies in NY</a> (including CodeAcademy, KickStarter, Foursquare, MakerBot, ZocDoc, Guilt, AppNexus, Tumblr, Etsy, KickStarter, Automatic&#8230; and mine!), most between the Flat Iron and SoHo areas of Manhattan (Silicon ALley). So I chose a few that, for one reason or another, I was interested in meeting and talk to their founders.

  * First I went to <a title="http://www.getharvest.com" href="http://www.getharvest.com" target="_blank">Harvest</a>. Had a sandwich and some water while Danny Wen told me how they are a self-funded company (finally someone who is not living out of &#8220;raised capital&#8221; while diluting their ownership). Interesting and successful, if one-product, company. Nice loft office, piano included. Not &#8220;too cool&#8221;, not &#8220;too cold&#8221;.
  * Since I had a bit of extra time, I walked to <a title="http://animoto.com" href="http://animoto.com" target="_blank">Animoto</a>. Talk about &#8220;too cool for school&#8221;. Some very nice touches, but, really 6 guitars, 2 keyboards, fussball, XBox&#8230; (then again, at our NY office we have ping-pong, basketball, and hammocks; and at our Spain office we have ping-pong, and a PlayStation). I use their very nice service, and their &#8220;themed meeting rooms&#8221; (particularly MarioLand) are great. But the need to prove goofiness, and indie, and gamify, and storify, and&#8230; you get the point. Too much. Forced. Not believable. Trying too hard (the PR story about this guy and his wedding was just unnecessary, absurd and unrelated).
  * On my way to the next meeting I had to do a teleconference with Uruguay, and another one with Peru, so I walked again (when will we have cell coverage in the subway?).
  * <a title="https://www.secondmarket.com" href="https://www.secondmarket.com" target="_blank">Second Market</a> was next. Nice design for a financial services company. Strange the number of desks and computers without anyone using them. And a surprisingly high number of young Jewish males wearing their kipa working there. I thought it might be interesting but I realized neither the service nor the technology was of too much interest to me.
  * Then I went to one I really wanted to see: <a title="http://artsy.net" href="http://artsy.net" target="_blank">Artsy</a> (formerly Art.sy, now Artsy.net). The best views of all of the offices I visited. Such amazing views that somebody wrote in FourSquare &#8220;If I had those views I would not get any work done&#8221; and somebody else replied &#8220;I have those views and I don&#8217;t get any work done!&#8221;. I liked their office, their attitude, and their technology (Open Source). 
  * My last stop (actually, I went back to Harvest to ask a question to their tech support director, but his answer is definitely not worth blogging about) was HookLoop, the $500 million Ny bet of <a title="http://www.infor.com" href="http://www.infor.com" target="_blank">Infor</a> on app refresh. Huge company. Really huge. Awesome mentality (eyecandy like I like it). Had a nice conversation with Dan (PR Director) at the CEO&#8217;s desk. Found some synergies. Will continue the talk with one of their VPs hopefully next week.

26,605 steps later (according to the app in my phone that tracks my movements), I got back home. Exhausted, but exhilarated. I love Silicon Alley.
