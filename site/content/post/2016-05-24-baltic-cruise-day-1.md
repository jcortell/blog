The next day, Saturday May 14, we had breakfast at the visitor center (with yet again some more deliciously rich Danish pastry) and took a taxi to the Cruise Terminal where we boarded the [Seabourn Quest for a 7 night Baltic cruise](http://www.seabourn.com/find-luxury-cruise-vacation/CruiseDetails.action?tourId=&webItineraryIdForAudit=E7N07S&fromSearchVacation=true&guestsCount=2&voyageCode=6728&#).

The ship is absolutely fantastic. It’s fairly new, exquisitely decorated, and we were assigned an amazing suite with a walk-in closet. Of particular excellence was the suite’s bathroom. I have only seen such a great bathroom in places like The Ritz Carlton Hotel (any, since they are all the same) or the UAE Emir’s Palace. I was seriously impressed with it!

For a small ship (450 passengers, versus over 5000 at Royal Caribbean’s Quantum of the Sea) the all the services were quite good (from the gym to the spa), and even the art was legitimately decent (although not as impressive as the Quantum of the Sea).

If I was forced to be critical of something, I could have said that the book selection in the library was weak, and the food could have been a bit more imaginative. But I was in for a wonderful surprise about the food (more abut it in another post).

So after toasting with the in-suite champagne and smelling the fresh flower welcome bouquet, we toured the ship, had dinner, and went back to our suite to select one of the many movies and documentaries available in the on-demand entertainment system. We chose a great documentary that I had been meaning to see even before it came out: “[Citizen Four](https://citizenfourfilm.com/)”.
