Halloween has arrived in Wimbledon. The multicolored leaves paint their annual natural mosaic, one of the many subjective manifestations where we can observe our mind at work, interpreting events. Do you get taken away by the beauty of the color range? Does it make you wonder why everybody finds beautiful a cyclical natural event that occurs because tree leaves die, fall and rot? Do you associate it with annoyingly unpredictable weather and uncomfortably falling temperatures? Or you picture warm drinks, being able to take long walks at noon, and extended baking sessions?

However you interpret (or not) this season, one cultural tradition in some Western countries is the carving of a pumpkin to turn it into a jack-o-lantern. This year was the first time my son did it, and it was and enjoyable moment (except for the jack-o-lantern, who ended up vomiting its own seeds). The resulting picture turned out good, with our ghostly castle as a perfect background.
