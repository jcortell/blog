Curious coincidence (or maybe not), two days after realising "something" was missing in one of my frequent logic diagrams, I saw anÂ <a title="https://youtu.be/k0xgjUhEG3U" href="https://youtu.be/k0xgjUhEG3U" target="_blank">episode</a> of _The Big Bang Theory_ in which Wollowitz discovers a flaw in Sheldon`s friendship algorithm.

Dr. Sheldon Cooper`s lack of a cycle counter in his <a title="https://sheldoncooper.org/sheldon-cooper-the-friendship-algorithm-quantum-mechanics-and-string-theory/" href="https://sheldoncooper.org/sheldon-cooper-the-friendship-algorithm-quantum-mechanics-and-string-theory/" target="_blank">friendship algorithm</a> is not a <a title="https://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/unisex/popculture/cb55/" href="https://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/unisex/popculture/cb55/" target="_blank">trivial issue</a>. The cycle counter is the "real life", "context", "awareness", "empathy", aspect of a logic interpretation of a social engagement. No wonder Sheldon missed it (and Wollowitz quickly noticed). Its importance for an Aspie can not be overstated.
