Last month we took the kids to an idyllic English countryside retreat: the <a href="https://www.fourseasons.com/hampshire/" target="_blank">Four Seasons Hampshire</a>, where we stayed in two adjacent suites.

Not far from London, it has everything a kid can dream of for a wonderful countryside vacation: green hills, a fishing pond, clay pigeon shooting, indoors heated swimming pool, bicycles, a large collection of DVDs, library, a playground, a rope-adventure course, a crocket lawn, tennis courts, a kids playroom with videogames, foosball, pool tableâ€¦ even a resident black labrador dog called Oliver!

But the main reason why we went there was for the horse experience. My daughter loves horses, and what do you do before you purchase a car? You test drive several, right? I figured it would be the same with horses. So we got to take care of them there: feed, wash, clean, groomâ€¦ and ride. It was truly magical. Toby (the horse) and Chloe (the stable girl) were very patient with us. 

The whole staff is also extremely nice and helpful, and the organic food is excellent. They even grow their own vegetables, have their own bee hives for honey, and a flock of hens for fresh eggs. 

A most delightful experience, one that we will cherish in the collective memory of our family forever. Thank you for making it happen @Cruise_Curator ðŸ˜‰
