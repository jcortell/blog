I`m still stuck in Baltimore, but it seems I will be able to return to NY <del>late tonight, arriving</del> tomorrow <del>morning</del> afternoon, the day after Halloween (which reaches amazing levels, like <a title="http://www.barbiecollector.com/shop/doll/haunted-beauty-ghost-barbie-doll-w7819" href="http://www.barbiecollector.com/shop/doll/haunted-beauty-ghost-barbie-doll-w7819" target="_blank">Barbie special edition dolls</a>).

So, instead of going to the <a title="http://halloween-nyc.com/" href="http://halloween-nyc.com/" target="_blank">Village Halloween parade</a> (which **has been cancelled for the first time in 39 years**), or <a title="http://www.newmuseum.org/calendar/view/new-museum-costume-party" href="http://www.newmuseum.org/calendar/view/new-museum-costume-party" target="_blank">any</a> of the Halloween parties I was invited to (the New Museum and Cara`s parties have also been cancelled), and wear the cool and simple MineCraft Creeper costume Cory Doctorow <a title="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/256847189479919616/photo/1" href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/256847189479919616/photo/1" target="_blank">twitted</a> (from Comic Con NY):

I will choose <a title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/30/hurricane-sandy-how-to-help_n_2045622.html?1351627814&ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/30/hurricane-sandy-how-to-help_n_2045622.html?1351627814&ncid=edlinkusaolp00000009" target="_blank">one of the volunteer efforts to aid</a> those most affected by Hurricane Sandy and get to work helping those in need... after some much needed sleep and a shower, of course.
