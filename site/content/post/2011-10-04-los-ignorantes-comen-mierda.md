According to this <a title="http://www.cracked.com/article_19433_the-6-most-horrifying-lies-food-industry-feeding-you.html" href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19433_the-6-most-horrifying-lies-food-industry-feeding-you.html" target="_blank">article</a> the food people usually eat (thanks to my wife and my conscience, I have slightly healthier eating habits than most people) is pure shit: wood celulose in many foods, fruit juices over a year old, ammonia in meat, artificial blueberries, &#8220;free-range chicken&#8221; that is not free at all, and other lies.
