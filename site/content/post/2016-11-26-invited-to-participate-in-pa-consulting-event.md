A few days ago I was invited to participate in a Healthcare Innovation workshop at PA Consulting in London.

Beyond the cute venue, and spectacular list of attendees from the healthcare, industry, and political spaces (“Don’t waste time talking to someone with ‘Lord’ in his title, they are not there to really work”, one of my colleagues advises me), what impressed me was the extremely well organized, choreographed, and disciplined approach to innovation they had. Quite a learning experience!
