The second week of January I flew to Lima (Peru) for an important business meeting. It was a hard trip: overnight flight from New York, straight to meeting, and overnight flight back. But there was no other way to fit the trip in my schedule.

A few days later I flew with my fiancée to Valencia both for business and for pleasure.It was a cloudy and &#8220;cold&#8221; week (for Valencia anyway, because 58ºF could hardly count as &#8220;cold&#8221;, considering it is 11ºF now in New York).

I realised how much of our culture and society revolves around food. Excellent and affordable food. We tried everything, from the home made paella, to the most sophisticated and interesting restaurant I have had the pleasure to try: the wonderful <a title="http://www.samsha.es/" href="http://www.samsha.es/" target="_blank">Restaurante Samsha</a>. Truly amazing.

It was also quite interesting to notice the first words she learned in Spain: _crisis_ (crisis), _paro_ (unemployment), _corrupción_ (corruption), and _ñam-ñam_ (yummy). Another symptomatic anecdote: we were invited to have dinner at the <a title="http://www.restauranterosmarino.com/es" href="http://www.restauranterosmarino.com/es" target="_blank">Restaurante Rosmarino</a> (The Westin Hotel where the Real Madrid soccer club and Honda Team happen to be staying that night), and there as a large table with customized menus for Bankia (the troubled savings bank inmersed in a huge corruption scandal). WTF!

We&#8217;ll be back soon.
