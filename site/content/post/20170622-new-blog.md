title: New Blog
---

As it should be evident, I have changed my blog.  
It's not a matter of style, but for a couple technical reasons:

1. My previous blog was based on WordPress, a CMS (Content Management System) that generated the blog from a database. That made data management a lot more cumbersome and less transparent than I wanted to
2. The performance and security of a blog based on a database is MUCH LESS than compared to one like the one I set up (this one), based on a "Static Generator"

Just so you have an idea, the previous blog got a 38/100 in performance tests, this one gets a 99/100:

- Time to start loading 428ms vs 21ms
- Time to full load 741ms vs 21ms
- Now it has HTTPS, HTTP2 and SSL certificate

Besides, now it is served from a CDN (Content Delivery Network) so it should be faster worldwide.

Of course I did not go through all the trouble just for my blog (I don't even look at how many people visit it), but to learn, and to test alternatives for my company's sites and blogs.

So after playing around with Jekyll, GitHub pages, Nikola, Octopress, and several alternatives, I've chosen Hugo with Gulp, Webpack, and Netlify, keepoing the content in a flat text format (markdown) under version control in GitHub.

By the way, migrating thousands of posts in Spanish and hundreds in English just took a few minutes, with a single error in a single line.

Awesome!
