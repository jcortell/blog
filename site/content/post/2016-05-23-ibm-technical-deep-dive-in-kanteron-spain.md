For a couple of days (May 3-4), IBM executives from Switzerland, France and Spain came to my company’s headquarters in Spain for a “technical deep dive”.

During those technical discussions (under NDA, so I’m afraid I can’t reveal any of what was said) other IBM executives dialed in from their respective countries.

Beyond engineering, market, and corporate discussions, we also had an opportunity to have fun. On day one we had a typical paella on the beach. On day two we went to the country club across the street for more Spanish food.

It’s not money or ambition that unites people, it is culture (weather, food, music, or science… all common languages).
