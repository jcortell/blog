The Spanish Consul General in New York, Juan Ramón Martínez Salazar, and the Commander of the Training Ship <a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_ship_Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Elcano_(1927)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_ship_Juan_Sebasti%C3%A1n_Elcano_(1927)" target="_blank">Juan Sebastián de Elcano</a> invited my wife and I to a gala reception aboard the beautiful sail ship (the third largest four-masted tall ship in the world, built in 1927), which is currently docked in New York`s pier 88.

It turned out to be a spectacular evening. The vessel was filled with celebrities: military, politicians with their secret service bodyguards, diplomats, sports, business and entertainment people. The military band played a medley of very Spanish tunes, and there was no shortage of _Ibérico_ ham, _Ribera del Duero_ red wine, and _arroz a banda_ rice, among other typical delicacies.
