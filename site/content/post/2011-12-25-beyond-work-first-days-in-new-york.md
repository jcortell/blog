To go to my <a title="Office" href="http://www.kanteron.com/blog/kanteron/2011/12/kanteron-systems-new-office-in-times-square-new-york/" target="_blank">office</a> in Times Square by subway is an adventure in itself, not due to the intense exercise of avoiding waves of pedestrians, but from the very fascinating tunnels (there is a world down there of abandoned stations, marginal dwellers, and those things nobody talks about)

<img class="aligncenter" title="42St Subway tunnel" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7152/6524134981_59166469ed_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" />to what one can find in the stations themselves: <a title="http://www.mta.info/mta/aft/muny/" href="http://www.mta.info/mta/aft/muny/" target="_blank">music</a> (from the <a title="http://www.sawlady.com/" href="http://www.sawlady.com/" target="_blank">saw lady</a>, to <a title="YBR" href="http://youbredraptors.com/" target="_blank">YouBredRaptors</a>), promotions (from an armored vehicle at the Army recruiting station at 42nd, to the Sesame Street characters wishing you happy holidays)&#8230;anything.

<img class="aligncenter" title="Sesame Street characters" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6524135055_3f5e3c1d61_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" />But these days belong to those few in which the work rythm slows down and one can take time to do other things, such as geting the <a title="http://www.nypl.org/" href="http://www.nypl.org/" target="_blank">NY Public Library</a> card (Schwarzman building, Bryant Park -with their never-ending lines to enter the ice-skating ring- is my new paradise), looking for a gym with swimmingpool (as usual, many options -Equinox, Reebok Club, 24hr fitness, etc-, but a good one, good location, and where you do not have to fork-over the month&#8217;s salary&#8230; is tougher to find), or a Jazz concert near home (Aaron Goldberg at the Jazz Standard, 3 streets away&#8230; all the other good clubs are at the Village)&#8230; there is so much to do and discover in this city!

Although, I have had to get into a new habit: looking up the weather prediction by the hour, since there is a big difference between sun shining dry and no wind (even if it is cold) and rainy windy day, and you can get all that in a day in NY&#8230; and the real cold has not even arrived yet!
