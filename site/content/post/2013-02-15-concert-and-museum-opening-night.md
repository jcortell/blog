On Wednesday we went to the &#8220;<a title="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/News-Events-Public-Programs/Calendar/Detail?id=15684" href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/News-Events-Public-Programs/Calendar/Detail?id=15684" target="_blank">Tribute to Elliott Carter</a>&#8221; concert at City University of New York Graduate Center (34th st & 5th Ave). A varied roster of (mostly) great (mostly) young performers, and Elliott Carter&#8217;s unmistakable&#8217;s compositions. I must admit it is not my favorite kind of music to say the least, but I do keep trying to expand my horizons. Always learning, or trying to. Experience, expose, try&#8230; isn&#8217;t that the hacker&#8217;s attitude?

But we had to leave the concert during the intermission in order to make it to the New Museum&#8217;s cocktail party and opening night for &#8220;<a title="http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/nyc-1993-experimental-jet-set-trash-and-no-star" href="http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/nyc-1993-experimental-jet-set-trash-and-no-star" target="_blank">NYC 1993: Experimental jet set, trash and no star</a>&#8220;. 

As it is so often the case with The New Museum, the exhibition had terrible things and a couple of very interesting pieces. But upon further thought, it makes perfect sense: we are talking contemporary art here. 1993. Twenty years (yes, I&#8217;m sure we all thought, at some point or another, when watching the exhibition &#8220;times flies, I remember when&#8230;&#8221;) is not enough of a perspective to discern.

> We are in the middle of it. And that, in itself, makes it wonderfully fun if not brainy deep – no matter how much the curator tries to make it look so in the silly information label/tag next to the works.

The evening ended with a delightful &#8220;sampler&#8221; dinner at the <a title="http://www.firmdalehotels.com/new-york/crosby-street-hotel/crosby-street-bar" href="http://www.firmdalehotels.com/new-york/crosby-street-hotel/crosby-street-bar" target="_blank">Crosby Hotel Bar and Terrace</a>.
