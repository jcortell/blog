  Random things seen in New York this weekend:
</p>

  * A big band of skaters (I only captured a few in my photograph becuase they were left behind in a stoplight, but there were many many more) rolling down south on Broadway. As they passed, people on the side walk greeted and cheered them. More play and less politics, or the return of the playful society, please. [Update.- there is a big story behind it: the <a title="http://observer.com/2012/10/broadway-bomb-blows-up-skaters-cred-in-court/" href="http://observer.com/2012/10/broadway-bomb-blows-up-skaters-cred-in-court/" target="_blank">Broadway Bomb</a>]
  * <a title="http://www.beechershandmadecheese.com/" href="http://www.beechershandmadecheese.com/" target="_blank">Beecher`s Handmade Cheese</a>, where you can sample and purchase artisanal cheese, have some wine and small apetizers in the cellar downstairs, but even more fun to just sit and watch them make cheese live, through a big glass.
  * Jack White`s <a title="http://thirdmanrecords.com/" href="http://thirdmanrecords.com/" target="_blank">Third Man Records</a>â€˜ Rolling Record Store wheels into locations all over the New York City, then tweets (@ThirdManRRS) each location. I saw it next to the Ace Hotel on Friday.
