On Monday 24 and Tuesday 25, I flew to Mexico for a quick and very important meeting. The meeting went really well, but as usual the highlights were the delicious restaurants my charming distributors take me to every time I visit. This time it was “<a title="http://www.nuevenueve.com.mx/#!/page_main" href="http://www.nuevenueve.com.mx/#!/page_main" target="_blank">Nueve y Nueve Bistro</a>”, a wonderful Hacienda renovated and modernized (Casa Lamm), which is not only a restaurant but also hosts several art galleries. I had delicious local fare, but I can not remember the names, so look at the pictures and enjoy 😉

An interesting anecdote is how my levels of SPO2 (oxygen in the blood) drop from 99% to 96% when I’m there. It’s fascinating how the environment (altitude, pressure, etc) affects our metabolism.

Before I headed back to New York, we had lunch at &#8220;<a title="http://www.lamansionmex.com/index2.html" href="http://www.lamansionmex.com/index2.html" target="_blank">La Mansión</a>&#8221; a restaurant inside the airport which was quite good too, just like &#8220;<a title="http://www.casaavila.com.mx/" href="http://www.casaavila.com.mx/" target="_blank">Casa Ávila</a>&#8221; was last time. Great restaurants, specially being inside an airport.

I guess I will be returning to Mexico soon, and this time I will read during the flight “Los Señores del Narco”, the very interesting book my friends told me about during my previous trip and now have bought me. Thank you!
