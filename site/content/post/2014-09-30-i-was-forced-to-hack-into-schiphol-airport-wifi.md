A couple weeks ago I was at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. Of course, when I arrive in an airport with enough time ahead of my boarding, I look for a plug and wifi. Luckily Schiphol is an excellent airport, offering both. The only problem is that every time I clicked on the &#8220;Enjoy unlimited free wifi &#8211; Connect&#8221; button, I got an &#8220;Unknown error 0&#8221; message back.

> Don&#8217;t tell me &#8220;Enjoy unlimited free wifi&#8221; and then try to prevent me from accessing it. That is cruel and just wrong. I was told to &#8220;Enjoy unlimited free wifi&#8221;, so I had to. To celebrate Free Software Day, you know.

I looked into the code, and saw an error. But luckily I also saw the way to by-pass it. All you have to do is to manually enter the correct URL, select the &#8220;Internet Voucher&#8221; option, and enter &#8220;schipholfreaccess&#8221; in both the ID and password fields (and accept the conditions). It will not give you an access screen, but you will be able to &#8220;Enjoy unlimited free wifi&#8221;.

Who said hackers are not obedient?
