This Tuesday and Wednesday I was invited to participate in <a href="http://enterprise.microsoft.com/en-us/event/empowering-health/" target="_blank">Microsoft’s 5th Health Innovation event</a>.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Titled “EmpoweringHealth: the journey towards more personalized, productive, collaborative and predictive health services & systems” it took place at the Microsoft Executive Briefing Center in Brussels.</span>

I participated in the round table “Medical Imaging Storage in the Cloud”, moderated by Kelly Limonte (Microsoft UK Healthcare Team), and in the Expert Panel “The future of preventive and predictive health powered by data in the intelligent cloud”, along with:

  * Fredrik Wetterhall &#8211; CEO Optolexia
  * Pablo Lapunzina &#8211; Head of Genetic Testing Department, Hospital La Paz, Madrid (Spain)
  * Mikko Rotonen &#8211; CIO, HUS (Finland)
  * moderated by Vincent Dupont, Director Health Partners, Western Europe – Microsoft.

I also participated in the Exhibition Area, along with 5 other selected partners.

It has been a very interesting event for professional purposes, but, as usual, I did not have a minute to enjoy Brussels.
