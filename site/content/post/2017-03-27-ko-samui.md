Friday, March 10, we arrived in Ko Samui, Thailand.
  
After taking a tender ashore, my wife and I we were picked and driven to the Belmond Napasai resort.

We had an absolute blast inspecting that property, and having a lot of fun on that most wonderful beach: kayak, snorkeling, paddle board, swimming, amazing local cuisine&#8230;

Back onboard, we attended a lecture by Denise Heywood on Cambodiaâ€™s history, traditional dance, and Angkor Wat.

After the lecture, my wife organized a cocktail party, where we talked and mingled with very interesting people.
