Perhaps all those people telling me &#8220;you&#8217;re trying to do too much at the same time&#8221; (thanks Ana, Remei, Juan&#8230;) were right. Perhaps moving to NY and trying to make my company grow, not to mention &#8220;personal life&#8221;, is already time-consuming enough. Or perhaps there are <a title="NY Times article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/why-science-majors-change-their-mind-its-just-so-darn-hard.html" target="_blank">other reasons</a>&#8230; but the truth is, I am dropping out of the fun and interesting AI course at Stanford University.
