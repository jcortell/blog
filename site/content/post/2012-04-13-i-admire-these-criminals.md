In Spain, <a title="http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1365573/0/reforma-codigo-penal/internet/resistencia-pasiva/" href="http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1365573/0/reforma-codigo-penal/internet/resistencia-pasiva/" target="_blank">the conservative PP government is planning to make &#8220;passive resistance&#8221; a crime</a> (as well as organizing demonstrations using internet technologies).

<img class="aligncenter" title="4 criminals" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mBDC64YbMzI/T4h9KaFWT-I/AAAAAAAABGo/ZdbxCQRq6Vs/w409-h545-k/20120413_141933.jpg" alt="" width="409" height="545" />

I have these 4 criminals&#8217; magnetic puppets on my fridge. 2 were outlawed (and had to flee) by German Nazis. 1 had to flee Spanish dictatorship because he was a Communist. And the other one was thrown in jail by British occupation forces for &#8220;passive resistance&#8221;.
