After a month traveling throughout Europe (posts and pictures soon), I returned to New York and I needed to catch up with work. In order to be more productive I had to tackle the "cable jungle" challenge. Quick and easy (and cool) solution? LEGO!

Just attach some velcro to the back of a Lego, attach it to the edge of your desk, get some of your favorite figures, have them "hold their arms up", and let them hold the USB and charger cables for you ðŸ™‚
