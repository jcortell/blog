Lying on the carpet, poetry book and pencil in hand, U2 in the background.

_October_ 

> October  
> And the trees are stripped bare  
> Of all they wear  
> What do I care
> 
> October  
> And kingdoms rise  
> And kingdoms fall  
> But you go on&#8230;and on&#8230;

So many literal meanings: the fear of wearing-out (The Edge was considering leaving the band like his brother did before they were even called U2), the false sense of security arising from self-defeat (&#8220;What do I care&#8221;), moving on after a loss (both Bono and Larry had just lost their mothers), the high hopes and expectations arising from new democracies in Eastern Europe only to become despair and dissapointment, and eventually resilience, surviving, going on&#8230;

Add that to the fact that Bono&#8217;s suitcase with the complete lyrics were stolen, he could only remember these lines, and decided to leave it like this, which is in fact quite poetic and coherently illustrative.

And then the personal meanings. This song speaks to me, with its haunting piano (the one song that motivated me to learn a little bit of piano when I was a kid), as I am sure it speaks to you. Today. In October. My October.

Of course, what song comes next?

&#8216;All I want is you&#8217;
