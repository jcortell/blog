Monday, March 6 we started the day with a wonderful breakfast buffet and then proceeded to tour the Fullerton hotel:
  


After that, we walked into the city to visit Chinatown, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, and had an amazing "street-hawk" lunch at Lau Pa Sat food center:
  


In the evening we went to the Gardens by the Bay, visiting the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, and exiting just as the Supertrees were doing their mesmerizing solar-powered light and music show:
  


To end a magical day, we went to the CÃ© La Vie rooftop bar (56th floor at Marina Sands by the Bay Hotel) to have a cocktail and enjoy the views:
  


And just as they were closing the doors, we managed a table to have dinner (the amazing 21-fold dumplings) at Din Tai Fung.
