This summer, for my mother&#8217;s birthday, my father invited the whole family (on both sides of the Atlantic) to a 7 night Mediterranean cruise from July 10 to July 17 onboard the <a title="http://www.msccruisesusa.com/us_en/Ships/MSC-Musica.aspx" href="http://www.msccruisesusa.com/us_en/Ships/MSC-Musica.aspx" target="_blank">MSC Musica</a>. Thank you dad!

We boarded in Valencia (Spain), and stopped in Marseille (France), Genoa, Rome, and Palermo (Italy), La Goulette (Tunisia), and Palma de Mallorca (Spain), before returning back to Valencia.

Although the ship is a mass market one (you could tell looking at the food, entertainment, and passengers), it was quite nice.

Day 1 we visited Marseille.

After a short stroll though the port area, its market, and downtown Marseille, we had lunch at <a title="http://www.hotel-residence-marseille.com/en/about-the-restaurant.html" href="http://www.hotel-residence-marseille.com/en/about-the-restaurant.html" target="_blank">Le Relais 50</a>, a very nice traditional Michelin-starred restaurant with great views of the port. We, of course, had a delicious bouillabaisse, and fish. To top it off, we had what it has become my favorite ice-cream at <a title="http://www.amorino.com/us/newsletter/page-shop/Marseille+-+Vieux+Port" href="http://www.amorino.com/us/newsletter/page-shop/Marseille+-+Vieux+Port" target="_blank">Amorino</a> (I just found out we also have an Amorino a few blocks from my apartment in New York, yeah!).

At night we had a gala dinner on board, and enjoyed the dance and acrobatics show before going to sleep.
