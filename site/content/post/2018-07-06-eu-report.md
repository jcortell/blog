Yesterday, the report that I co-authored for the EU back in April, was finally approved and released.

<!--more-->

Here are the details of the report:

"Driving Progress for Research and Innovation in Europe - The potential of R&I foundations" written by the European Commission Expert Group on “Foundations, Venture Philanthropy and Social Investments”
[European Commission, Directorate-General for Research and Innovation](https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/research-and-innovation_en)
Directorate B - Open Innovation and Open Science
Unit B3 - SMEs, Financial instruments and State Aid

ISBN 978-92-79-86892-4
doi: 10.2777/434029
KI-01-18-621-EN-N

Although it's © European Union, one thing I checked before accepting the job was that reuse is authorized (provided the source is acknowledged).

The EC has plans for an official launch of the report in Q3 or Q4.

My liaison in the EC tells me:

> We have already achieved an important milestone:

> COM/2018/435 (interne CE / externe CE) - PE/2018/3673
> Proposal for a REGULATION OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL establishing Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, laying down its rules for participation and dissemination - RTD - adoptée: 07/06/2018 10:04:19

Here's the full report:
