April 8 to 17 I travelled to Valencia and Barcelona (Spain).

In Barcelona I participated in the <a title="https://www.transbio-sudoe.eu/transbio-events.php?n=2" href="https://www.transbio-sudoe.eu/transbio-events.php?n=2" target="_blank">II Emergence Forum by Transbio Sudoe</a>, a gathering of academics, companies & technological platforms from Spain, France, Portugal with the objective of setting up collaborative projects. I gave a lecture and participated in an expert panel.

The event allowed me to meet very interesting people, and visiting the <a title="https://www.bsc.es/" href="https://www.bsc.es/" target="_blank">Barcelona Supercomputing Center</a> (with its Mare Nostrum supercomputer, in the most amazing set-up you could even imagine) and the <a title="https://www.pcb.ub.edu/homepcb/live/en/p1.asp" href="https://www.pcb.ub.edu/homepcb/live/en/p1.asp" target="_blank">Barcelona Scientific Park</a>. I also took the opportunity to meet several executives from Roche Pharmaceuticals at their software headquarters for Europe.

In Valencia, besides of course visiting family, friends and colleagues, I had several meetings (National Research Center Prince Philip, Valencian Institute of Oncology, Healthcare Research Institute, and Imegen Labs). I also signed the legal founding documents of my new company: <a title="https://www.innomedyx.es/" href="https://www.innomedyx.es/" target="_blank">Innomedyx</a>.
