One of the multiple interesting pieces currently being exhibited at the New Museum`s <a title="http://cortell.net/blog/2012/03/the-ungovernables-party-at-new-museum/" href="http://cortell.net/blog/2012/03/the-ungovernables-party-at-new-museum/" target="_blank">The Ungovernables</a> is Amalia Pica`s _Venn Diagrams_. The text under this piece says:

> During the period of dictatorship in Argentina in the 1970s, gatherings of citizens were closely monitored as they were considered a threat to the government. At the same time group theory and venn diagrams were banned from primary school programs as they could provide a model for subversive thought.

Brutal and ignorant as any other dictatorship (or even more if you wish), I knew Argentinian Military Junta was capable of something as absurd as this and more (like banning Sigmund Freud`s doctrine and exterminating psychoanalysts... in Argentina of all places!), but since it seemed so shocking, I went on and researched a little.

Here is a detailed account of what happened: <a title="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rQoAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22argentina%22+dictatorship+%22set+theory%22&source=bl&ots=GmqgZvQDlu&sig=N5yGaPAhvYUdP29UIJh9ZFx8zEs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0MBGT42YKYmp0QWDtIiMDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false" href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rQoAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22argentina%22+dictatorship+%22set+theory%22&source=bl&ots=GmqgZvQDlu&sig=N5yGaPAhvYUdP29UIJh9ZFx8zEs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0MBGT42YKYmp0QWDtIiMDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank"><em>Who is afraid of a vector?</em> By Mauricio Schoijet</a>.

When discussing <a title="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2012/02/5290152/%E2%80%98-ungovernables%E2%80%99-more-serious-and-political-its-predecessor-still-ha?page=all" href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2012/02/5290152/%E2%80%98-ungovernables%E2%80%99-more-serious-and-political-its-predecessor-still-ha?page=all" target="_blank">Art as Political Discussion</a> (even more than when discussing Art), there is never enough context.
