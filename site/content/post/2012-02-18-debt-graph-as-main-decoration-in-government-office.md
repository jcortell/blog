On Monday, I met the Chief Information Officer of a large US Government Administration in Washington DC.

His office was surprisingly small and functional compared to European "big government" offices. A nice reminder of how European bureaucracy and public sector spending in administration itself is burying us. But what caught my attention the most was the largest picture in the office: it was not Obama`s, a diploma, a family picture, a flag... it was this:

I wish European (particularly Spanish, and particularly Valencian) public servants were so aware of and sensitive to the realities and constraints that should be ever present in their duty.
