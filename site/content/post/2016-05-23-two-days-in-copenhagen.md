Thursday, May 12 we travelled to Copenhagen, Denmark. We had many things on our list, and being there for two days only, we had to make many sacrifices. But overall, we covered a lot of ground.

But overall, we covered a lot of ground.Upon arrival in the airport we took the very convenient and modern train that took us to the Central Station, and our hotel was next door. The Radisson Blu Royal was the original design hotel, and you can see Arne Jacobsen’s hand in everything, from the staircase to the chairs.

We checked in, left our suitcases, and walked towards our dinner reservation at Taarnet, the restaurant in Christiansborg Palace and Parliament tower, walking by the Royal stables, the library, and the Danish Jewish museum.

Dinner was, as we expected, delicious. All the dishes were excellent, but without a doubt the most amazing one was a seemingly simple one: the cheese platter. Three absolutely perfect Danish cheeses, with an incredible rye bread toast that tasted so distinctively good that I can perfectly recall it several days later.As an added bonus we got to go to the top of the tower and enjoy some great views of Copenhagen.

The next morning we had breakfast at the bakery in the Nimb Hotel.

Danish pastry is famous for a reason. TheSmørrebrød open-faced sandwiches were good, but the pastry was divine. These Danish sure know how to work their dairy!

After the hearty breakfast, we left for a long walk that took us to the City Hall Square, through the pedestrian Strøget Nygade and Østergade, all the way to Nyhavn with its lively marina full of tourists and locals enjoying the sunny day.

We walked back through Havnegade (jumping in the public trampolines as the kids we are) past Kayak Republic, to cross the Knippelsbro bridge, so we could make it to Freetown Christiania.

I must say it was a disappointment. There are many examples of self-organized communities around the world and throughout history that prove its sustainability, and even desirability… if done right. But cheesy merchandise stalls and many people smoking weed do not a community make. The saddest part? Their “Museum”. The coolest? The indoor skate park.

In a shameless contrast we headed straight for Noma, the culinary temple. I’ve wanted to dine there for years, but never had the chance. I knew it would be pointless to try to make a reservation a few days ahead (as they take reservations months ahead), so our best and only chance was to go there and hope for some last minute cancellation. Unfortunately nobody had the misfortune to miss their reservation, so we left sad and dragging our feet, promising to be back with a proper reservation next time.

On our way out we visited the Icelandic Cultural Center, although the exhibition on display was not really worth it.

We crossed the bridge back, and went through Søren Kierkegaards Plads into The Black Diamond (modern extension of the library and quite an active cultural center). After a little break, we continued through the pedestrian Købmagergade to the Round Tower, and ended up in the Kings Gardens, filled with teenagers having a great time enjoying the sunny day. We walked all the way to the Rosenborg Castle, and then back to Kongens Nytorv to the Hotel D’Angleterre, with its adorable Lego reproduction of the hotel in the lobby. It is a fine hotel, very tastefully renovated, and definitely our choice for next time.

My wife had a business meeting there, and once she was done, we walked towards our dinner reservation (after all, what were the chances that Noma would have a last minute cancellation?) in Almanak. It might not be Noma, but everything was artisanal (even the apple sparkling wine) and local, and absolutely delicious.

To call it a day, we went to Tivoli Gardens.


  
Tivoli Gardens is quite charming at night with magical gardens, carnival rides, fairy lights. Some of the highlights of the night: we attended three outdoors rock concerts, saw a robotic lawn mower in the shape of a rabbit that had its own “mini hotel-reproduction charging-station”, and basically enjoyed walking through such a darling place.

Two things that really stick out in Copenhagen: how homogeneous the population is (like my wife likes to say: everyone is tall, thin, healthy, blonde and so white), and the incredible amount of bicycle riders absolutely everywhere; as a matter of fact, quite often you see many more bicycles than cars waiting behind a red light!
