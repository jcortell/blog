April 12th to 15th we went to Chicago, to attend the largest Healthcare IT show in the world (HIMSS), presenting Kanteron Systems solutions at the Hitachi Data Systems booth.

We stayed at <a href="http://www.publichotels.com/chicago/home/" target="_blank">The Public Hotel</a>. We made friends, had fun (thank you for inviting us to the Lexmark Healthcare party, Jeff), and enjoyed the nice weather!
  
Oh, yeah, and we worked a lot too.
