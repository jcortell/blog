My visit to Palermo was a brief one, because there is not much of interest for the kids and in any way I prefer the North of Italy to the South: climate, personality, food, culture... so we disembarked, were incessantly approached and solicited by local "tour guides" and other merchants as you would expect in the North of Africa, took a walk – fortunately the seaport is near the city center – and went back to the ship.
