Walking towards my London Shoreditch office
  
to meet the Swiss investor and his impeccable suit,
  
leaving the City bankers’s coffee-holding fast pace behind,
  
I notice the absence nobody seems to
  
Where did he go?
  
His sleeping sack and pillow still on the sidewalk
  
as annoyingly positioned in the corner as always
  
But he’s gone
  
.
  
I wonder and I worry
  
his failing body, almost as absent as his lost gaze
  
with nobody to return it,
  
had been a constant and silent companion of my daily walk
  
We never spoke, but we connected
  
He needed help that I did not offer
  
but he was also longing for a contact that I did accept
  
with my eyes and my smile
  
He fed on that with desperate hunger
  
but I fear that could not keep his body alive
  
.
  
I look for him
  
Did he finally manage to gather enough crumbs in the form of coins
  
to enter the new temple of exclusive abundance
  
and be able to reach for an edible item that might keep him going for one more day?
  
Or did he perish, vanish, and was removed out of our sight and our path?
  
In that case they did not remove him from my life, from my heart,
  
where you all live, far away from me
  
.
  
As my gaze, still in the lookout, turns the corner
  
in the hopes that he’s defacing the wall with his urine,
  
I see the ultimate social irony:
  
inside the <a href="http://www.bloombergspace.com/artists/upcoming/tim-etchells/" target="_blank">Bloomberg Space</a>
  
a neon sign
  
someone most definitely put up for me today

The romantic poet in me stops there
  
no more words, no more thoughts,
  
the insulting irony has spoken, in obvious terms, to nobody
  
.
  
But I can not
  
CAN NOT
  
let it go
  
and enraged with fury and disbelief
  
I go on
  
determined as I always was
  
to subvert the system
  
to penetrate it, hack it, and milk it
  
for then I will have the dirty tools the system uses to turn our alienation against us
  
.
  
And then the day will come when we will see each other as one, and the world will be full of “us”,
  
as there will no more “them”,
  
and then I will be gone
  
for my job will be done
  
.
  
I see you
  
open your eyes
  
.
  
35000 decisions a day
  
this is the one
  
I’m not hiding
  
.
  
Hello Mr. Banker
  
here’s my soul
  
give me the tools
  
to obliterate your world
  
and free you all
