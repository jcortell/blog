Saturday, October 8th, I attended day 1 of the <a href="https://exponential.singularityu.org/medicine/2016program/" target="_blank">Singularity University Exponential Medicine Conference in San Diego</a> at the amazing Hotel Del Coronado.

The event was organized mainly by Will Weisman and the incomparable Daniel Kraft, MD (whom I met last year at the London Stock Exchange), both from Singularity University.

The Conference was fully packed with activities. Morning activities started at 7am and included Yoga, Meditation, Art, and Beach Run. Evening activities changed every day, and included things like Team Collaboration & Innovation Games, Gadget & S’mores Bar, Music & Magic at the Bar, UnConference, or Silent Disco.

There was also an expo area called The Innovation Lab, where innovative companies showcased their latest and greatest.

But, without a doubt, the most important part of the conference was the extremely interesting and thought-provoking speakers and subjects. Day 1 included, [amongst many others](https://exponential.singularityu.org/medicine/2016program/):
