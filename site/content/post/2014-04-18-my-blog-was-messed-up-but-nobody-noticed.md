Actually, a couple people told me &#8220;What&#8217;s up with your blog? you haven&#8217;t posted anything for ages, and the categories are broken&#8221;. But other than that, nobody noticed, or cared, or both. Which is weird because on the other hand, my Google+ page is about to hit a million visits, and my LinkedIn profile is in the top 5%&#8230; :S

Oh, well. The truth is, the blog was indeed messed up because of a quick server migration, and I had not posted anything in a long time because I am insanely busy. But here I am. Hello.
