This summer I have had several work meetings around London. Some of the most interesting, cool and fun:

  * At London Blackfriars Railway Station
  * NHS Test Beds 2nd round event at the Kia Ovalâ€¦ with a live cricket match going on! (it was somehow distracting, if only because I don not understand this game)
  * Handing out student awards at PwC
  * At London BioScience Innovation Centre
  * At Google
