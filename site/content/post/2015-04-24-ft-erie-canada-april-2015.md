April 16-24 we went to Ft. Erie, Canada, to spend some time with the family.

We had a wonderful time, catching up with work, dining in fine places, and even doing a little sightseeing: the misty Crescent beach, Peller Estates Winery, or dinner at Tiara, in Queen&#8217;s Landing. But we enjoyed our time at home, and the delicious home-cooking, the most.
