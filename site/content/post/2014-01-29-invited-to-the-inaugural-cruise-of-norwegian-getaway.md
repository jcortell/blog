My wife and I were invited to the inaugural cruise for the <a title="http://www.getaway.ncl.com" href="http://www.getaway.ncl.com" target="_blank">Norwegian Getaway</a>. A &#8220;sister ship&#8221; to the Norwegian Breakaway, in which inaugural we cruised last year, this ship is almost exactly identical. 

We enjoyed fine dining at Le Bistro, Taste, and The Tropicana, cocktails and music at Bliss, and particularly entertainment:

  * Comedian <a title="http://ralphharris.com" href="http://ralphharris.com" target="_blank">Ralph Harris</a> at the Headliners Comedy Club 
  * <a title="http://www.burnthefloor.com" href="http://www.burnthefloor.com" target="_blank">Burn the Floor</a> the musical
  * Illusionarium, a pretty good steam-punk themed magic show with dinner
  * Buddy Valastro (<a title="www.carlosbakery.com/" href="www.carlosbakery.com/" target="_blank">Cake Boss</a>) live cake decorating session

The return to port and docking gave us a nice view of Manhattan&#8217;s skyline, along with the scary view of the Hudson river with big chunks of ice (locals say that was unseen since 1977). Now back to ice cold New York.
