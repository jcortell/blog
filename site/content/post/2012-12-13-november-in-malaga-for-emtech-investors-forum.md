The last week of my November trip to Spain, I went to Malaga for the MIT Technology Review <a title="http://www.kanteron.com/blog/entrepreneurship/2012/11/kanteron-systems-selected-to-participate-in-mits-emtech-2012/" href="http://www.kanteron.com/blog/entrepreneurship/2012/11/kanteron-systems-selected-to-participate-in-mits-emtech-2012/" target="_blank">Emtech Investors Forum event</a>.

It was very sad and unfortunate that the mayor of Malaga did not listen to the organizers of the event, and stubbornly forced the event to be inaugurated November 22nd &#8220;becuase it was more convenient for him&#8221;. Since the main interest of the event were the US investors, they did not come because it was Thanksgiving. Thank you Mr. mayor!

Nevertheless, Malaga is always a nice city to visit. So the most important part of the trip was indeed to meet with friends. Not bad.

[Update: By the way, Schiphol&#8217;s airport remains one awesome airport]
