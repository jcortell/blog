From the 6th to the 8th I was <a title="http://cortell.net/blog/?p=4484" href="http://cortell.net/blog/?p=4484" target="_blank">back in Montevideo</a> (Uruguay) for business. Taking an all-night flight there (via Miami) to minimize time away, my time there was very productive, packed with interesting business meetings and presentations. It was worth the 5,339 miles.

I was lucky to meet with some very interesting doctors and executives, and to try some good restaurants (like Dueto and La Perdiz), although I added many more (Estancia del Puerto, Arcadia, Estrecho, Wasa, Sucre Sale, Raffi, Cafe Bar Tavare, and Rara Avis) to my list, since I am sure I will be back soon.

Some curious trivia I learned from my excellent hosts: 

  * Uruguay has won more Copas de America soccer cups than Brazil or Argentina, and nobody can explain how. This drives Argentinians and Brazilians crazy.
  * Uruguay`s current Defense Secretary (Eleuterio Fernández Huidobro) is a former terrorist, who was captured, tortured and imprisoned for many years by... the military!
  * Montevideo`s most expensive real estate area is where the former prison was. Now there is a big shopping mall and a Sheraton hotel there.
