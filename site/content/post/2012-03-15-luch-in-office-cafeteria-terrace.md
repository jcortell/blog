  Today is the first day that feels like summer. So I seized the moment and took my potato-leek soup and veggie burger out to the office cafeteria terrace (7th floor overlooking Times Square). Pure delight!

  [By the way, the cafeteria is great: a wide range of cold and hot food options, at subsidized prices for Viacom-MTV-Nickelodeon and associated companies` employees (and tenants like me)... cheaper than buying it in the supermarket!]
