The day at Palma was very nice. We strolled through town, enjoying the Cathedral`s altars (by <a href="https://www.catedraldemallorca.info/principal/es/patrimonio/arte/gaudi-menuitem" title="https://www.catedraldemallorca.info/principal/es/patrimonio/arte/gaudi-menuitem" target="_blank">Gaudi</a> and <a href="https://www.catedraldemallorca.info/principal/es/barcelo" title="https://www.catedraldemallorca.info/principal/es/barcelo" target="_blank">Barcel√≥</a>), the typical architecture, tried some sobrasada, bought some ensaimada, and went back to the ship feeling at home. After all, I spent many summers in nearby Ibiza and visited Mallorca many times.
