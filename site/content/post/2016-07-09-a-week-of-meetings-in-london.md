After the trip to Boston I came down with the flu, of course on a weekend as usual. So Monday I had zero energy, but a week ahead with an usual large number of meetings around London, so I had to do “magic calendar tricks” to be able to make all of them and to also attend several events. The main “trick” is to concentrate meetings geographically, adding into the calendar the time it takes to go from point A to point B.

The meetings ranged from the Economic and Commercial Office of the Spanish Embassy in London to entrepreneurs seeking advice to potential investors and advisors.

On top of the meetings, I had a ton of conference calls and events. The only event I was invited to, I missed, and I really wanted to attend was the premiere of the documentary [Design Disruptors](https://blog.invisionapp.com/design-disruptors-premiere/).

The upside of hectic weeks like this is that I get to meet very interesting people (this week alone: an Oxford professor, a Baroness former Secretary of State for Health, two PhD entrepreneurs, a world-leading strategic investor advisor, the owner of a Chelsea art gallery, the head of a top law firm, CTOs of some of the largest technology companies in the world, etc), I get a lot of exercise done, and I get to enjoy the city.
