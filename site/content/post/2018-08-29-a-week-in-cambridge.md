For a mix of work and vacation time with the kids, we spent a week in Cambridge (UK).

<!--more-->

The main objective of the trip was a work meeting with the head of the [high performance computing group](https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/compbio/) doing genomic research at the University of Cambridge, to reach a collaboration agreement between them and my company, Kanteron Systems.

Once that meeting took place, at the [Cambridge Blue](https://cambridge.pub/the-blue/), and we reached an agreement, I spent the rest of the week trying to make the kids happy in Cambridge's miserable weather.

We went horseback riding, and to a horse breeding complex, [The National Stud](https://www.nationalstud.co.uk/), one of the largest in the world. But between the rain and the very cold temperatures, what we enjoyed the most was to stay at home (we stayed at a friend's house) playing scrabble... and fighting off a cold.
