On Thursday our friend Marsha invited us to attend the Garden City Hotel Gilded Revelry event: reopening of Grand Ballroom.

At first it did not seem that interesting, specially taking into account that we had to ride the LIRR train for 40 minutes from Penn Station (changing in Jamaica) to Long Island. But once we arrived, we quickly admitted it was a good idea.

A renovated Grand Ballroom hosting two acrobats, an electric violin and a DJ with projections of historic photos from the hotel in the background for entertaining, and the real highlight of the night: the most amazing sushi bar I have ever had the pleasure to experience on one side, and an awesome and delicious hors d&#8217;oeuvres buffet on the other. All well coupled with excellent reds, whites and champagne.

It was definitely a fun and enjoyable Thursday night.
