According to <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:

> The **uncanny valley** is a hypothesis in the field of [robotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics") and [3D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics "3D computer graphics") [computer animation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_animation "Computer animation"), which holds that when human replicas look and act almost, but not perfectly, like actual human beings, it causes a response of [revulsion](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revulsion "wikt:revulsion") among human observers. The &#8220;valley&#8221; in question is a dip in a proposed graph of the positivity of human reaction as a function of a robot&#8217;s human likeness.

> The term was coined by the robotics professor [Masahiro Mori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori "Masahiro Mori") as _Bukimi no Tani Gensh?_ (???????) in 1970. The hypothesis has been linked to [Ernst Jentsch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Jentsch "Ernst Jentsch")&#8216;s concept of &#8220;[the uncanny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uncanny "The Uncanny")&#8221; identified in a 1906 essay, &#8220;On the Psychology of the Uncanny.&#8221;<span style="font-size: 11px"> </span>Jentsch&#8217;s conception was elaborated by [Sigmund Freud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud") in a 1919 essay entitled &#8220;The Uncanny&#8221; (&#8220;[Das Unheimliche](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Unheimliche "Das Unheimliche")&#8220;).

It is my hypothesis that the emotional-relationship difficulties experienced by someone suffering from Asperger&#8217;s Syndrome (or by someone having to interact with such individual), may be very well explained by the Uncanny Valley hypothesis.
