On Monday I traveled to Paris for a quick meeting.

It was my first time on the Eurostars train, and I love it: to be able to work all the way from downtown London to downtown Paris, without wasting time going back and forth airports, and having a very reliable punctuality, is great.

In Paris I met a business partner briefly at the Gare du Lyon, and then my customers at Le Train Blue restaurant and business space. Then back to the Gare du Nord and to London.

It’s a pity to be in Paris and not have time to wander around, go to museums, or just enjoy the sunny day, but sometimes that’s [work]life.
