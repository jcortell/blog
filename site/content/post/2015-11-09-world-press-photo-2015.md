Last Thursday, on my way to a business meeting, I stopped by the Southbank Center, to view the [World Press Photo 2015](https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/2015) exhibition. It was a great collection of pieces, but I particularly liked (or was most shocked by) the work of Tomas van Houtryve (2nd prize stories), Cai Sheng Xiang (1st prize singles), Turi Calafato (3rd prize stories), and Arash Khamooshi (3rd prize stories).

Definitely worthwhile visiting.
