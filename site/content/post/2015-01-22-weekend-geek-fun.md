I have been lucky enough to experience a couple of weekends in a row at home in NY, which means friends and fun. From having dinner at a friend`s apartment in the upper East side, and with another heterogeneous group of friends (New York Times journalists, lawyers, and people from the food and restaurant industry) at <a href="http://mercatonyc.com/" title="http://mercatonyc.com/" target="_blank">Mercato</a>; to more geeky things like having lunch in <a href="http://www.macondonyc.com/" title="http://www.macondonyc.com/" target="_blank">Macondo</a> with Pepe and Sandy from the <a href="https://openitp.org/" title="https://openitp.org/" target="_blank">Open Internet Tools Project</a> so we could talk about the <a href="https://openitp.org/festival/circumvention-tech-festival.html" title="https://openitp.org/festival/circumvention-tech-festival.html" target="_blank">Circumvention Tech Festival</a>; to reading and writing about what art is and means (what better place to do that than NY); to replacing a hard disk drive for a new solid state drive; to finally watching BlackHat and the last Hobbit movie on the big screen... I`m fortunate to have a wife that finds all those activities fun ðŸ˜‰
