Now that the good weather seems to have arrived to NY, I will be walking more (more than my two hours daily that I already walk), and will be more willing to stop and take photographs of the crazy stuff one sees on the streets every day. Here are some images before April 2013.

(Note: the fun Einstein and Freud images were taken at Chelsea Market, from an exhibition by <a title="http://www.funnyfoodart.com" href="http://www.funnyfoodart.com" target="_blank">FunnyFoodArt</a>).
