In a sort of &#8220;NY diary&#8221;, here is what the last two weeks of June had in store for me.

  * June 17th:

I went to <a title="http://www.chaanteahouse.com/" href="http://www.chaanteahouse.com/" target="_blank">Cha&#8217;An</a> in the heart of the East Village, for a very delicious tea ceremony. And it was delicious not just because of the great _matcha_ tea (_usucha_) and _wagashi_, but also because Noriko-san was such an excellent host, performing an excellent _otemae_. Being a public restaurant, and not a private house, not everything was &#8220;perfect&#8221;, like in the _tokonoma_, where the scroll was obviously generic. But all in all, the experience itself made it wonderfully delicious.

After that, lunch at <a title="http://www.sobaya-nyc.com/" href="http://www.sobaya-nyc.com/" target="_blank">Sobaya</a> across the street was a great surprise: everything was above average. Another good Japanese restaurant to add to the list.

A little walk took me to the fun and expensive <a title="http://www.superdry.com/" href="http://www.superdry.com/" target="_blank">Superdry</a> SoHo, on the way to the Film Forum to see the Marina Abramovi? documentary (more on that in another post).

  * June 23rd:

Vegan lunch at <a title="http://www.angelicakitchen.com/" href="http://www.angelicakitchen.com/" target="_blank">Angelica Kitchen</a>, dessert at the sweet <a title="http://milkbarstore.com/main/stores/" href="http://milkbarstore.com/main/stores/" target="_blank">Momofuku Milkbar</a>, and tea at the eclectic _americana_ <a title="https://plus.google.com/109771275799021535384/about?gl=us&hl=en" href="https://plus.google.com/109771275799021535384/about?gl=us&hl=en" target="_blank">Podunk</a>.

  * June 24th:

<p style="text-align: left">
  <a title="http://teany.com/" href="http://teany.com/" target="_blank">Teany</a>. Long time no see!

  * June 28th:

<p style="text-align: left">
  Dinner at <a title="http://www.caravanofdreams.net/" href="http://www.caravanofdreams.net/" target="_blank">Caravan of dreams</a>. While the quality has decreased and prices increased with the new owners, it&#8217;s still a place worth visiting.
</p>

  * June 29th:

<p style="text-align: left">
  Dinner at <a title="http://kajitsunyc.com/" href="http://kajitsunyc.com/" target="_blank">Kajitsu</a>. An experience out of this world. Kajitsu serves <em>shojin</em> cuisine, an ancient Japanese cuisine developed in Zen Buddhist monasteries. Impossible to describe. Really, something unlike anything you may have tried before&#8230; and I have tried hundreds of restaurants around the world!
