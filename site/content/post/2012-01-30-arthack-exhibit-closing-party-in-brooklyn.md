Last Saturday I went to the <a title="http://arthackday.net/319scholes/" href="http://arthackday.net/319scholes/" target="_blank">ArtHack Exhibit</a> closing party at <a title="http://319scholes.org/art-hack-day/" href="http://319scholes.org/art-hack-day/" target="_blank">319 Scholes</a> St, Brooklyn (New York).

Located in an industrial complex in Brooklyn, at night, loooong two blocks from the subway, graffiti all over, small door... that gave way to heaven: young (I was the oldest hacker in that space, but I did not feel that way) energetic happy people tinkering with technology and proudly showing their "toys" (hacks, mashups, creations, or whatever). From the 15sec-at-a-time Star Wars fan-boy movie, to the shoot-the-DJ video game, including the bicycle computer interface, the "swim" in front of a kinect to navigate with a browser, the mesh-connected game-of-life sync router status lights, the iPhone jump-rope, the Tororo figure being sculpted by the MakerBots (Replicator and Thing-O-Matic), the <a title="http://gif.ahprojects.com/" href="http://gif.ahprojects.com/" target="_blank">GIF Booth Hack</a> as demonstrated by Ashley and Katie... it was all great fun.

As a bonus, on the way back, I got a twilio tshirt, several stickers (Etsy, MakerBot, Alphaonelabs...) and great photo opportunities of the surroundings. That is what I call a great Saturday evening.
