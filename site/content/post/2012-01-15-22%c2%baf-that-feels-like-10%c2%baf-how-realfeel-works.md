<a title="http://www.accuweather.com/" href="http://www.accuweather.com/" target="_blank">AccuWeather</a> has an interesting system called RealFeel. For example, today is 22ÂºF, but when you step outside, you can&#8217;t help scream &#8220;Shit, it&#8217;s cold!&#8221;. Accourding to the AccuWeather&#8217;sÂ RealFeel system (which I assume <a title="http://www.experts123.com/q/how-does-the-patented-accuweather-realfeel-temperature-work.html" href="http://www.experts123.com/q/how-does-the-patented-accuweather-realfeel-temperature-work.html" target="_blank">takes into account more than just humidity</a>, like wind), it feels like 10ÂºF. What it does not take into account is if you forgot your hat, scarf, or gloves (then you are lost, even if you wear UniQlo&#8217;s HeatTech undies) ðŸ˜‰
