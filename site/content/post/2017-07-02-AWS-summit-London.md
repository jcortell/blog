Last Wednesday, June 28, I was invited to the [Amazon Web Services Summit in London] (https://aws.amazon.com/summits/london/), which took place at ICC London, ExCeL.   

It's always:
 
* A learning experience to see the latest technologies being applied
* Interesting to learn from the presentations
* Important to keep up with the latest trends
* Good business to connect with potential customers or partners
* Fun to get swag, from free demo accounts to books and t-shirts :D
