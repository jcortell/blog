As I mentioned in my previous post, at IBM Innovation Center in Chicago they have a <a title="https://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.html" href="https://www-03.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/index.html" target="_blank">Watson</a>Â (more info <a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)" target="_blank">here</a>) interactive kiosk with which to play an interactive game of Jeopardy. In case you have been living in a cave for the past few months, Watson <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLR1byL0U8M" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLR1byL0U8M" target="_blank">beat</a> Jeopardy human champions on live TV, the <a title="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17jeopardy-watson.html?pagewanted=all" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/science/17jeopardy-watson.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">significance</a> of which can not be overstated.

Now, remember: this is a "small version" of Watson, and a "self-contained" version of Jeopardy. So, no, I did not beat the full Watson at the full Jeopardy game. As a matter of fact, I only had time for a few questions, and I am absolutely certain that give enough time, Watson would have crushed me. I have only deep admiration at the incredible job IBM has made with Watson. They are making history in a way we con not even begin to understand yet. They are definitely changing the world, and for the better.

Having said that, let the glory glow bathe me for a minute. After all, how many people can show a picture of their score ahead of Watson`s at Jeopardy? Take that, Dr. Cooper... Bazinga! ðŸ˜‰
