November 27th I flew to Boston, and back to NY in the same day, for a couple of important business meetings (Massachusetts General Hospital, and a Law Firm) with Ken and Laura, with whom I had lunch in a restaurant located inside a hotel that was formerly a prison.

November 28th I flew to Chicago for the RSNA trade show.

I stayed at the very nice <a title="http://www.publichotels.com/chicago/home/" href="http://www.publichotels.com/chicago/home/" target="_blank">Public Hotel</a>, attended the crazy big RSNA show, had dinner at <a title="http://www.petterinos.com/" href="http://www.petterinos.com/" target="_blank">Petterino</a>&#8216;s with Brazilian friends, and flew back to NY.
