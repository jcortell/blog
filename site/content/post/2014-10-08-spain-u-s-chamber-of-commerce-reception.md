Last Wednesday I was invited to attend a reception honoring the new Chairman of the Spain – U.S. Chamber of Commerce, retired Ambassador Alan D. Solomon, at Hunton & Williams.

Located at 200 Park Avenue, NY – Met Life building, floor 52 (if I remember correctly) the views were outstanding.

It was definitely a “business attire” reception, with everyone wearing a suit, and only a couple of us “daring” not to wear a tie. It cracks me up.

Most of the major Spanish companies were represented, and I had a chance to ask Inaki Berenger for a recommendation for a good investment bank (thanks Inaki!), to catch up with friends like Alejandro Cremades, and to listen to the excellent and funny speech by Mr. Solomon, who I am sure will be a great Chairman of the Chamber.
