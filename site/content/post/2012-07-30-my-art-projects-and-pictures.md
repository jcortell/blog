For a few years I have accumulated art projects and pictures, in that oh-so-common delusion "one day I will start working on this and..."

Well, reality, resource constraints, day-to-day life... are all excuses not to take one`s passion and live it. So I am going to live it. How? I don`t know. But the first step is to share, and to make accessible, my plans, ideas, and projects.

So <a title="http://jcortell.tumblr.com/tagged/Art-project" href="http://jcortell.tumblr.com/tagged/Art-project" target="_blank">HERE ARE MY ART PROJECTS (tumblr)</a>, and <a title="http://500px.com/jcortell" href="http://500px.com/jcortell" target="_blank">HERE ARE MY PHOTOGRAPHS (500px)</a>.

Next: book ideas, songs I have composed... and you already have my <a title="http://cortell.net/blog/category/otras-cosas/rafagas-literarias/" href="http://cortell.net/blog/category/otras-cosas/rafagas-literarias/" target="_blank">literature bits HERE</a>.
