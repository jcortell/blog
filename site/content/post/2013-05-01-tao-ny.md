Last weekend we went to <a title="http://taorestaurant.com" href="http://taorestaurant.com" target="_blank">TAO</a> to celebrate a birthday. For a large size restaurant that has been in operation as long as they have, it is amazing that the service was decent, the vibe cool, and the food good (special mention for theÂ _ruby dragon_ cocktail). It was fun.
