Thanks to <a title="https://SaraJChipps.com/" href="https://SaraJChipps.com/" target="_blank">Sara</a>, there is a very easy way to add code to your site to protest against SOPA:
  
Drop the following code in between your two <HEAD></HEAD> tags on your site, your users will be redirected to the blackout page that describes what you are doing and why.
  
`<br />
<script><br />
window.location = "https://protestsopa.org";<br />
</script>`

Then, when the protest is over, simply remove the added code.Â The protest is starting at 12am on 1/18, and lasts 24 hours.
