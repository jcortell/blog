Sunday, March 5, we flew from London to Changi airport, in Singapore. Flying to Asia from London is a lot easier and shorter than from New York; I guess living in London had to have some advantage over our beloved NYC!

When we arrived we received the VIP treatment at the iconic, and absolutely perfectly situated, Fullerton Hotel: we were greeted by our names curbside right off the taxi by a lovely lady that walked us directly into our room, without the need to stop at a reception desk or fill out any paperwork! In the room, we had a handwritten (who does that anymore?) welcome letter from the hotel’s general manager, a fruit plate and a bottle of wine. Nice.

Although we were tired from the long flight and it was already evening time, we left our luggage in the room, had a gourmet snack in the executive club, and went to take a walk around the bay.

Since it was Sunday, the Marina Bay waterfront promenade was busy as everybody wanted to see the daily sight show. But there were also some children activities set up (like the Art Zoo Inflatable Park), so the atmosphere was definitely very family-oriented.

After the walk and light show, we went to the Makansutra Gluttons Bay for her to try some of the famous “street-hawk” food I could not stop talking about since my first trip to Singapore. But since we had not yet changed Singaporean currency, our options were limited to the only vendor that took credit card payment.
