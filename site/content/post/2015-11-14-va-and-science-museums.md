Sunday November 8th we went to the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Science Museum for some educational fun weekend.

I love the V&A for its interesting variety. We saw sculptures (although lot more Rodin than Bernini), Medieval objects (from reliquaries to clothing and drawings), and some fine examples of Japanese design.

In the Science Museum we went to see the small but extremely interesting exhibition on Ada Lovelace’s history. We learned a lot and I believe it was a great inspiration to my son. I can’t wait to take my daughter there.
