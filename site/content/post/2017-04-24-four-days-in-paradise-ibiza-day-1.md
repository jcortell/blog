After my daughter’s first concert, April 13-16 we took a little family vacation and went to the Mediterranean island of Ibiza.

Ibiza has a very special place in my heart. As a kid, I spent many summers enjoying “my own private little beach” in paradise, before there were any jet-setters, dance clubs, or large yachts on the island. There were only hippies and fishermen. It was heaven.

So I decided it was about time to take my American wife and two kids to the island.

We took the two and a half ferry ride from Gandia, so we could bring along my car and as much luggage as needed.

Upon arrival, we went straight to Portinatx, on the northernmost tip of the island, where we had rented a cozy and traditional beachfront two-bedroom apartment.

The views from the terrace were breathtaking, so we unpacked and run to the beach to enjoy Ibiza’s legendary sunset (best experienced from the West side of the island), with my daughter to capture the scenes with the camera and great sensitivity, while my son remained in the apartment “setting up the internet”. Then, as everything else was already closed, we went to a local bar for a quick dinner and to sleep early, as the following day we wanted to beach-hop all day.
