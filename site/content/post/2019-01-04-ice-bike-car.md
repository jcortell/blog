Today we went ice skating, and rode ice bikes and ice bumper cars, at Buffalo's Canalside. Cool!

We Valencians are not used to so many winter fun activities. [Ice skating](https://www.canalsidebuffalo.com/events/public-ice-skating-2/2019-01-04/)? Sure! Just like roller skating, but wearing blades, on ice.
[Ice bikes](https://www.waterbikesofbuffalo.com/ice-bikes/)? Whaaat? OK, like bicycles, but on ice. OK.
[Ice bumper cars](https://www.canalsidebuffalo.com/events/bumper-car-rentals/2019-01-04/)? Is there anything these Buffalonians don't do on ice? :D

Anyway, it was all fun... but I still prefer regular skating, bicycles, and bumper cars, in 70Â°F weather (which is what they have right now in Valencia, Spain... shall we go now?).
