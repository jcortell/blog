I have no clue about physics or philosophy. But just like, when thinking theoretical physics, I can`t help but reach the conclusion that time is a form of energy, when I think of epistemology, I can`t help but to think of it in a multidimensional matrix, of which we can usually only grasp part, because the interconnexions we trace are linear an unidirectional.

It`s a well known fact that our brain is not built to comprehend reality, but "to make sense" of it. And this is my attempt.

Just saying.
