After wasting hours trying to double space or insert extra line breaks when writing a new post or page in WordPress only to see that WordPress automatically filters the content to remove those extra spaces once you click the ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù button, I have found the solution (not as obvious and not readily available in support forums) by using the <a title="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tinymce-advanced/" href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tinymce-advanced/" target="_blank">TinyMCE Advanced plugin</a>, which adds additional functionality to the default WordPress editor, including the ability to stop WordPress from automatically stripping out ‚Äúp‚Äù (paragraph) and ‚Äúbr‚Äù (line break) tags. Just install, go to "settings>TinyMCE Advanced" and click on the last option.
