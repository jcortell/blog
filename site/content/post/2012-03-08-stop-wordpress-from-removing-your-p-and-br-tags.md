After wasting hours trying to double space or insert extra line breaks when writing a new post or page in WordPress only to see that WordPress automatically filters the content to remove those extra spaces once you click the ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù button, I have found the solution (not as obvious and not readily available in support forums) by using the <a title="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tinymce-advanced/" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tinymce-advanced/" target="_blank">TinyMCE Advanced plugin</a>, which adds additional functionality to the default WordPress editor, including the ability to stop WordPress from automatically stripping out ‚Äúp‚Äù (paragraph) and ‚Äúbr‚Äù (line break) tags. Just install, go to &#8220;settings>TinyMCE Advanced&#8221; and click on the last option.
