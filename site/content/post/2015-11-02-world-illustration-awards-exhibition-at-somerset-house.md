On Sunday October 31st we went to the <a href="http://www.theaoi.com/awards/" target="_blank">World Illustration Awards</a> <a href="http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/about/press/press-releases/world-illustration-awards-2015-exhibition" target="_blank">Exhibition at Somerset House</a> (London). It was a pure delight. Not only it was hosted at one of my favorite venues in London, but the selection of works by contemporary illustrators was quite good. The one I liked the most was Malika Favreâ€™s Futurist-inspired posters for the BAFTAs 2015, but there were many remarkable ones, like Bartosz Kosowski&#8217;s perfect poster for Kubrick&#8217;s _Lolita_, the cheerfully cute drawings of Chris Haughton for the Royal London Children&#8217;s Hospital, the super busy &#8220;Larger Than line&#8221; by Mattias Adolfsson, the powerful and colorful &#8220;Alice in Wonderland&#8221; art by Grahame Baker-Smith, or the iconic &#8220;Autism&#8221; work by Aad Goudappel (one copy of which I acquired for our private collection).
