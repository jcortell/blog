I have just bought a <a title="http://oneplus.net/" href="http://oneplus.net/" target="_blank">OnePlus</a> One phone, and have been using it for a couple of days. Let me tell you: it`s AMAZING.

If you have never heard of the company, don`t worry, you`re not alone. But you should definitely check it out, because their phones are incredibly high quality, high specs, and low price (mine was $349). No catch:

  * QualcommÂ© Snapdragonâ„¢ 801 processorÂ with 2.5GHz Quad-core CPUs
  * Adreno 330 GPU, 578MHz
  * 64 GB eMMC 5.0
  * 3 GB LP-DDR3 RAM, 1866MHz
  * global 4G LTE
  * NFC5.5" 1080p display
  * 13 megapixel 6 lens camera
  * Tri-microphone with noise cancellation

I decided to get one of these because my Samsung Galaxy S II was getting old, and I wanted to go from the limited stock Android, full of my cell carrier`s bloatware, to a more open and free Cyanogen Mod (11S), which will also allow me to experiment with advanced cell cryptography.

Purchasing one of these phones is not that easy. I guess they want to control the huge demand they are experiencing. But I got an invitation, so I decided to use it ðŸ˜‰

Upon receiving the package I felt something I had not feel since the first iPhone: like a fan-boy. Sorry Apple, you lost your touch long time ago, and many of us just despise how you do not care about user`s rights and freedoms.

OnePlusÂ has put a lot of care in every detail. And after a couple of days of spending too much time using the phone (who wouldn`t?) I must say even the batter life is amazing!

AWESOME JOB, OnePlus guys!
