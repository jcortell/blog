On Friday I was invited to attend <a title="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/News-Events-Public-Programs/Calendar/Detail?id=12135" href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/News-Events-Public-Programs/Calendar/Detail?id=12135" target="_blank">Slavoj Žižek&#8217;s lecture &#8220;Conditions of Possibility&#8221; with M. Hägglund & A. Johnston at City University of New York&#8217;s Graduate Center</a>.

Martin Hägglund (associate professor of comparative literature and humanities at Yale University) and Adrian Johnston (professor in the department of philosophy at the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque and a faculty member at the Emory Psychoanalytic Institute in Atlanta) both read legthy and endogamic discourses about Heidegger, classic philosophical concepts, and stubbornly narrow minded &#8220;canons&#8221;. You can not make philosophy (then again, they were reading and regurgitating, not creating or philosophizing) and begin by taking for granted Kant, Heidegger, Hegel, Lacan&#8230; We are in the XXI century! Of course those were great philosophers, and their contributions are extremely significant, but that does not mean they are unquestionable. As a matter of fact, that&#8217;s what philosophy is about!

**Isn&#8217;t it about time we look beyond the fatality of cause-and-effect, the linearity of time, the etnocentric and anthropocentric view of philosophy?**

On the contrary Žižek, in his well known flamboyant manner (his tics have gotten much worse, I wonder about his health), and making a few, but not too many (which was a welcomed change) pop-culture references, did not read, questioned his colleagues, and went on about seemingly disparate subjects that eventually tied in together quite well.

I may not agree with all Žižek says, but one has to respect such a risk taker in a world dominated by idolatrous worshipping ass kissing experts and their endogamic and excluding entourage.
