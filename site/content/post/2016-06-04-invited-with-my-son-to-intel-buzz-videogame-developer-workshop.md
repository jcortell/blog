Today I was invited, along with my son, who at 14 has been a videogame developer for years, to attend the [Intel Buzz videogame developer workshop](https://intelbuzz.bemyapp.com/2016/london/). It was not only a lot of fun, but WONDERFUL to attend with him!

Although a small event, it ended up being extremely interesting, with an area to try indie games and new technologies, and a long list of talks and panels, including one-on-ones.

Almost all of the indie games showcased were really good. My favourite was _Elise: Unpainted Memories_:



The speakers were amazing, like:

  * Ed Fries, Co-founder of the Xbox Project and Microsoft Game Studios
  * Kate Edwards, Executive Director of the International Game Developers Association (IGDA)
  * Oscar Clark, Evangelist for Everyplay & UnityAds, Unity Technologies

    Will Eastcott, CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://playcanvas.com">PlayCanvas</a>

The talks and technology were really interesting, and the games and technology we tried (like the [Rovr](https://www.rovr.rocks)) were super cool. But the two main conclusions are: VR is all the rage, and it`s going to be everywhere soon (coming to Chrome for Android in October!), and there were a lot of women attending (which is great, and hopefully a sign that gender equality is finally arriving to the tech industry).
