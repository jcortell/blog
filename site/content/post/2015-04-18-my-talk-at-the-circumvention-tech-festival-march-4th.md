This past winter I met Sandy and James from Open ITP in New York, and Pepe from Valencia. They were organizing the <a title="https://openitp.org/festival/circumvention-tech-festival.html" href="https://openitp.org/festival/circumvention-tech-festival.html" target="_blank">Circumvention Tech Festival</a>¬†to be held in Las Naves, Valencia (Spain) March 1-6.

They invited me to give a talk, which was eventually scheduled for March 4th at 3pm. I titled the talk ‚ÄúWhen _privacy_ does not mean the same to you and me‚Äù. It was meant to generate debate, to expose other people‚Äôs points of view, rather than to be a unidirectional speech.

Nonetheless, my talk was but one of many meetings, talks, workshops, and debates that James, Sandy and the whole team put together. iRex, Tor, Pirate Party, Censorship.no, Ooni, Xnet, Alkasir, ASL19... It ended up being one of the most awesome events of this kind I have ever attended, with circumvention activist and journalists from all over the world sharing their experiences and projects with the community.

The last night I threw a party for all those who wanted to attend at Kanteron`s offices in Valencia. We had fun üôÇ

I can‚Äôt wait for next year‚Äôs edition!
