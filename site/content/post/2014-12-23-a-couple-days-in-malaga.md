On Wednesday 17 I arrived in Malaga (Spain) via Zurich for a couple of important business meetings. The meetings went really well, but I also enjoyed this very special city.

It had been a while since I was last in Malaga, so I went back to my favorite places: La Tetería teashop (right in front of the Picasso Museum), and the Contemporary Art Center <a title="http://cacmalaga.eu" href="http://cacmalaga.eu" target="_blank">CAC</a>, where they have a small but always excellent and ever-changing display of works. This time I saw the movie “Casting Jesus” by Christian Jankoswki, the first solo exhibitions in a Spanish museum by Maurizio Cattelan, Manuel Leon, and Adrian Ghenie, and other works by artists like Basquiat or Warhol.

At night the streets in the pedestrian city center where fully packed, but although I was invited to a wine-tasting party, I decided to go to the hotel, work a little bit, take a hot bath, and go to sleep as early as I could.

The next day, after a very interesting business meeting, I took the US and UK visitors to have lunch at the very traditional restaurant El Pimpi, where we had chestnut-fed (even better than acorn-fed) black-footed iberico ham, Ribera del Duero red wine, and other Spanish delicacy tapas like organic artichokes, baby squids in tempura, stew croquettes.

Right after lunch, I left for Valencia.
