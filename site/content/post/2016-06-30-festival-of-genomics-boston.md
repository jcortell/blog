June 28 and 29 I attended, along with my friend John Memarian, President & CCO of my company [Kanteron Systems](https://blog.kanteron.com/), the [Festival of Genomics Boston](https://www.festivalofgenomicsboston.com/), as a [Microsoft Genomics Group](https://microsoft.com/genomics) partner.

Although the show was small, it was a great opportunity to network with industry and academic experts (from Harvard Professors to Illumina executives) and learn.

From scientific posters to the latest sequencing technologies, from robotic arms to genomics experiments in space, it was great #geekfun.
