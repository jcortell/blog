> Accompanied by your absence  
> I hear your skin calling.  
> Silently, still, I answer.
> 
> In the solitude of your presence  
> I remember sliding down your gaze  
> fearlessly falling into your void,  
> your being`s foyer.
> 
> Next to you, finally, I rest   
> dreaming and longing,  
> with the peace and tranquility that comes from   
> knowing me you.Â
