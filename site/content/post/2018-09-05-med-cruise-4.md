September 7th was our 6th Mediterranean family cruise day onboard the [Norwegian Epic](https://www.ncl.com/ca/en/cruises/7-day-western-mediterranean-from-barcelona-EPIC7BCNNAPCIVLIVCEQPMIBCN/schedule?&itineraryCode=EPIC7BCNNAPCIVLIVCEQPMIBCN&customerStoriesCurrentPage=1&customerStoriesPageSize=3), spending the day in Cannes.

There is no doubt that Cannes and the whole French Riviera (or Côte d'Azur) is nice (no pun intended), but I prefer Spanish beaches. Much less posturing and economic inequality.

After a walk through Cannes, and the obligatory crêpe, we had a good time in the bowling alley and the ship's games room.
