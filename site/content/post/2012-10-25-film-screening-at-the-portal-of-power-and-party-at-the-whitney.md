On Wednesday I was invited to the screening of the documentary "<a title="https://www.gregorycrewdsonmovie.com/" href="https://www.gregorycrewdsonmovie.com/" target="_blank">Gregory Crewdson Brief Encounters</a>" at <a title="https://www.thecoreclub.com/press/" href="https://www.thecoreclub.com/press/" target="_blank">the Core Club</a> (that has been called the "Portal of Power" by The New York Times, or "Where the 1 Percent Go to Lunch" by CNBC), with popcorn, M&Ms, wine bar and all.

Both Ben Shapiro and <a title="https://www.artsy.net/artist/gregory-crewdson" href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/gregory-crewdson" target="_blank">Gregory Crewdson</a> (and his mother) were there introducing the film. But their shyness made them refuse a formal Q&A session, so to talk to them one had to go to the reception area after the film and mingle and chat. I didn`t ask any question because although I appreciate the enourmous productions he makes (it was a little dissapointing to learn in the film that he makes digital corrections), and the particular aesthetic accomplished, I would need more than a quick question and answer with the artist. Here is a nice <a title="https://www.artsy.net/post/editorial-artsy-asks-gregory-crewdson-uta-barth-and" href="https://www.artsy.net/post/editorial-artsy-asks-gregory-crewdson-uta-barth-and" target="_blank">interview</a> with him on Artsy.

After that I was again invited (black Audi Q5 car and all) to the <a title="https://whitney.org/Events/OpeningReceptionFall2012" href="https://whitney.org/Events/OpeningReceptionFall2012" target="_blank">party at the Whitney Museum to celebrate fall exhibitions</a> _Wade Guyton OS_ and _Richard Artschwager!_ It was more crowded and by a more (dare I say) "fun" crowd than at the typical New Museum party (or MoMA or MET for that matter). I even wore my "exclamation point sticker" on my forehead. Quite a conversational piece, it seems. Which made sense, I thought, considering it made reference to one of the works being exhibited. But nobody seemed to know or notice that, tough... "little details".

PS: Today someone has told me I have earned the right to be called a _fl√¢neur_, so I have changed the title of this blog, to incorporate that perfectly apt adjective.
