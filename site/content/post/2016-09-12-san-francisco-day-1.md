After over 11 hours of flight from London in Virgin Atlantic, in which I caught up with movies I had not seen yet, I arrived in San Francisco Saturday, September 10.

Being as I am a sucker for all things Japanese, I got a room at the [Hotel Kabuki](http://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/california/san-francisco-hotels/hotel-kabuki/), located in the middle of [Japan Town](http://sfjapantown.org/).

I was tired from the long flight, but I took a walk around the Japan Center, and I`m glad I did, because I enjoyed going intoÂ Kinokuniya Bookstore, Daiso, Ichiban... so hard to resist not buying everything!

I had a light dinner (takoyaki and mitarashi dango) at [Kissako Tea](http://sfkissako.com/Buy_Ippodo_Teas.html), watched how the [sumo wrestlers](http://sfjapantown.org/events/sumo-champions-exhibition/) finished their autograph signing, and walked back to the hotel with them (where I had fun calculating if the elevator`s capacity sign took into account those "extra-large" individuals).
