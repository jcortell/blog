For second consecutive year, my company has been named “Top Scaleup in the UK”. This means that we are growing fast, and also that I get invited to cool events. One of those events was a reception and a ‘Ten Years From Now’ series of keynotes at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, another one a mentoring session at London’s City Hall, and another one a series of talks at Google Campus. Some of the people I met at those events were:

  * Brian Forda, Crypto Currency Professor, MIT
  * Maria Contreras-Sweet, Director, USA Small Business Administration
  * Megan Smith, US Chief Technology Officer, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
  * Obi Felten, Director, Google X
