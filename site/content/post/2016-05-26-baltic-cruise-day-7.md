Friday, May 20, we arrived in Helsinki quite early and docked by Kauppatori (Market Square) where they sell a ton of berries (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, etc), which we have been eating a ton during the cruise.

So, after breakfast we disembarked, and walked the Senate Square, got a map in the City Hall, where we also took the opportunity to check our email thanks to the free wifi, and went on, passing by the Helsinki Cathedral, the Palace of the Council of the State, the main building of the University of Helsinki, and the National Library.

Through the commercial avenue Aleksanterinkatu we reached the Finnish National Theater, the Ateneum Art Museum, and the Central Railway Station. The Station is an impressive building outside, but not that exciting inside.

Next to it, and past the main Post Office, is the Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma, where we spent a while before continuing on to the Green District passing by the Helsinki Music Center, the Parliament Building, and the National Museum.

Walking up Karamzininranta, we strolled around the Töölönlahti lake, before coming back towards the station via Alvar Aallon katu.

Since we still had a little time, we decided to visit the Design District, walking down Erottajank all the way to the Eira Hospital before turning back towards the ship via the Tähtitornin park.

Once back on the ship we were invited to any treatment in the spa. We had fun doing the Kneipp Walk (cold and hot water at ankle height), followed by a couple’s massage that lasted over an hour. After the massage, I went into the sauna: almost 100ºC (200ºF) at 10% humidity for 15 minutes! The funny thing is that I did not break a sweat until minute 12.

Since the ship was departing Helsinki, we had a late lunch on the deck by the pool and then went back to our suite to rest.
