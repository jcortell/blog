On May 10 I traveled to Manchester for a business meeting.

After the meeting, I had a couple free hours left before boarding my train back, so I decided to walk around Manchester University (where I will be attending a Bioinformatics Course soon) and visit the eclectic and adorable Manchester Museum.
