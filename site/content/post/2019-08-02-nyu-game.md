On Wednesday we attended the New York University Student Show.

As a final project, my son and his team had produced a cool videogame and a tabletop game. We played with them and other games produced by other students.

We also enjoyed NYU's amazing videogame library (game consoles, games, and books). On the way home, my daughter and I stopped to have lunch at Oh! Taiso.
