August 22-24 my wife and I went to Madrid, since she had not been there before.

We stayed at the wonderful [Hotel Villa Magna](http://www.villamagna.es/), in Paseo de la Castellana. A very discreet luxury hotel where every single detail is just right, from the room amenities to the &#8220;just right&#8221; breakfast buffet.

The first day we visited the [Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a (MNCARS)](http://www.museoreinasofia.es/), where the budget cuts really show, although it continues to be a reference in contemporary art. Picasso&#8217;s _Guernica_ still moves me every time I see it.

We had dinner at the trendy creative tapas place [Sala de Despiece](http://www.academiadeldespiece.com/sala-de-despiece/) with our friend Alvaro.

The next day we went to the [Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum](http://www.museothyssen.org/) in the morning, were invited to lunch at the brand new and awesome [Gran Melia Palacio de los Duques](http://www.melia.com/en/hotels/spain/madrid/gran-melia-palacio-de-los-duques/restaurants.html), after which we walked to the Royal Palace, saw the Almudena Cathedral, and then visited the [Prado National Museum](https://www.museodelprado.es), where organization is so terrible, they make visitors wait for over half an hour under the sun to buy tickets. We had cocktails while listening to live piano music at [The Ritz Hotel](http://www.mandarinoriental.com/ritzmadrid/), and then we walked through El Retiro Park (and its whimsical Crystal Palace) to reach our dinner destination: [Mercado de Ibiza](http://mercadodeibiza.com/).

The last day we had a very hearty buffet breakfast before doing a car tour of the city and heading back to Valencia.
