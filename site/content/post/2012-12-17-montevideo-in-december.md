December 2nd I flew to Montevideo. I stayed at the <a title="http://www.radisson.com/montevideo-hotel-uy-11100/urumont" href="http://www.radisson.com/montevideo-hotel-uy-11100/urumont" target="_blank">Radisson Hotel</a>, Plaza de la Independencia. Very conveniently located with some impressive views from the top floor. Good thing it had a pool, because it is not easy to keep my exercise regime when traveling so much.

Besides very productive meetings with IBM (very nice, professional, and friendly executives, by the way) and presentation to several hospital groups (one of the meetings at the Presidential Building, another one at the country`s largest hospital, and a presentation at the Solis Theater), I enjoyed the promenade by the river which seems like a sea, the old town, and a weird Ice Bar.

December 6th I flew to Lima for a day trip of intense meetings and negotiations. My friend Jose Carlos made an extra effort to make sure I ate some Peruvian food and fruit juices, which I really like, even though the trip was really short on time. Thanks!

The odd episode was in the airport: although I did have a boarding pass, since the machine did not scan it (later on I saw it was broken, but of course the idiot operating it kept saying it was not a machine problem), I had to get a new boarding pass and pay airport tax! No time to argue, had to catch a flight, and I did.
