  When, in the same week, you receive the "<a title="http://www.nyc.gov/html/oem/html/get_prepared/ready.shtml" href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/oem/html/get_prepared/ready.shtml" target="_blank">Ready New York â€“ Hurricanes and New York City</a>" brochure from NYC Office of Emergency Management via postal mail, and an SMS from "Emergency Alerts â€“ National Weather Service" with the text "Imminent severe alert Flash Flood Warning this area til 1:00PM EDT. Avoid flood areas. Check local media", you realize "you are not in Valencia any more, boy".
