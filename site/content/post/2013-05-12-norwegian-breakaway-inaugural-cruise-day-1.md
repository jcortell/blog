We were invited to board the <a title="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/latest/christening/" href="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/latest/christening/" target="_blank">Norwegian Breakaway inaugural</a> cruise last Friday. A huge (146,600 tones and 1,062 feet for 4,000 passengers and 1,595 crew) and brand new ship.

It was a short inaugural cruise, 100 miles into the Atlantic Ocean, for VIPs (the bankers that financed the construction of the ship, Norwegian Cruise Lines executives, journalists, "star" travel agents... even Mayor Bloomberg). Many well known people aboard: artist Peter Max, who designed the hull and was signing posters, _Iron Chef_ Geoffrey Zakarian (with his Ocean Blue restaurant as one of the 27 the ship has)... As we went through the very fast and easy boarding procedure at Pier 88, even President Obama flew over the ship in his helicopter!

It was very nice of Norwegian Cruise Lines to also invite 150 New York-area mothers with their kids (today is Mothers Day in the USA) who had been affected by Hurricane Sandy. 

On day 1 (Friday) we toured the ship, and had dinner with an NCL rep. and a few other people (like a former Broadway actor and producer and his partner, who will be starring in _Spamalot_ in New Jersey`s <a title="http://www.smilingrhinotheatre.com" href="http://www.smilingrhinotheatre.com" target="_blank">SmilingRhino Theater</a> next June).

After the delicious dinner (polenta, lobster, bread pudding...) at the <a title="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/ship/restaurants/savor-restaurant/" href="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/ship/restaurants/savor-restaurant/" target="_blank">Savor Restaurant</a>, we had a stage side table to see the <a title="http://www.rockettes.com" href="http://www.rockettes.com" target="_blank">Rockettes</a> and "<a title="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/ship/entertainment/burn-the-floor/" href="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/ship/entertainment/burn-the-floor/" target="_blank">Burn the floor</a>" at the <a title="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/ship/restaurants/the-manhattan-room/" href="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/ship/restaurants/the-manhattan-room/" target="_blank">Manhattan Room</a>.

As if that was not enough for a night, we also enjoyed the great performance by <a title="http://slamallen.com/fr_slamallenwebpage.cfm" href="http://slamallen.com/fr_slamallenwebpage.cfm" target="_blank">Slam Allen Band</a> at the <a title="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/ship/entertainment/fat-cats-jazz-and-blues-club/" href="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/ship/entertainment/fat-cats-jazz-and-blues-club/" target="_blank">Fat Cats Jazz & Blues Club</a>.

The night finally ended in the <a title="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/ship/staterooms/mid-ship-balcony/" href="http://www.breakaway.ncl.com/ship/staterooms/mid-ship-balcony/" target="_blank">Mid-ship State Balcony room</a>, falling to sleep on a very large and comfortable bed, to the very gentle rocking of a sailing ship.
