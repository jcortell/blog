On Thursday I went to the New York Museum of Arts and Design (<a title="http://www.madmuseum.org/" href="http://www.madmuseum.org/" target="_blank">MAD</a>). Honestly, I wasn`t expecting much, but... on the contrary, what a nice surprise!

From Japanese exquisite design and art (subtle, delicate, and sensitive beauty that never ceases to soothe your soul) in "<a title="http://www.madmuseum.org/null/exh/beauty-all-things" href="http://www.madmuseum.org/null/exh/beauty-all-things" target="_blank">Beauty in all things</a>", to the awesomely curated "<a title="http://www.madmuseum.org/null/exh/swept-away" href="http://www.madmuseum.org/null/exh/swept-away" target="_blank">Swept Away:Â Dust, Ashes, and Dirt in Contemporary Art and Design</a>", to the amazing "<a title="http://www.madmuseum.org/null/exh/glasstress-new-york" href="http://www.madmuseum.org/null/exh/glasstress-new-york" target="_blank">Glasstress New York</a>", the whole museum was a joy to visit. So much so that I am considering joining as member.

Two extra points worth mentioning: their awesome website that lists **every** work of art on display (that`s the way **all** museums should do it), and the "No More Modern: Notes on Metamodernism" film series (more on that in another post).
