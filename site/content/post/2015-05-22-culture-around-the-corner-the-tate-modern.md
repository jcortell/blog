Living in London means being surrounded by culture. For example, in less than 5 minutes’ walk from our apartment, and without even crossing the London Bridge, we have the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern" target="_blank">Tate Modern</a> (Britain`s national gallery of international modern art), <a href="http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/" target="_blank">Shakespeare’s Globe Theater</a>, <a href="http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/" target="_blank">Southbank Centre</a> (Europe’s largest centre for the arts: theatres, concert halls and a cutting edge art gallery presenting over 1200 events each year), and <a href="https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/" target="_blank">BFI Southbank</a> (the leading repertory cinema in the UK, specialising in classic, independent and non-English language films, operated by the British Film Institute).

So last weekend we started out exploration of the amazing cultural opportunities we have around the corner by going to the Tate Modern. We focused on the Level 2 “Making Traces” zone, centred around the perfectly displayed and breathtaking Mark Rothko’s “Seagram murals”, and surrounded by amazing works by Gerhard Richter, Magda Cordell, Lee Bul, George Condo, Rebecca Horn, Sam Francis, or Brett Weston, among others.

Before we left for the day (we will return many many times), we peaked at the “Poetry and Dream” zone, in the same Level 2, which surely require many hours of devoted attention, and we saw some works by Giorgio de Chirico, Picasso, Dali, Miro, Man Ray, Bill Viola… so much to enjoy, so little time!
