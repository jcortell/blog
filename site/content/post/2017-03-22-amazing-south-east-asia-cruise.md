For a couple of weeks in March, I have been cruising throughout South East Asia.

My wonderful wife, for my birthday, invited me to cruise with her on the [Crystal Symphony](http://www.crystalcruises.com/voyage/details/7205#details) to: Singapore; Koh Samui, Bangkok/Laem Chabang (Thailand), Sihanoukville (Cambodia), Ho Chi Minh City, Chan May (Vietnam), Sanya, Hong Kong SAR (China).

In a series of forthcoming blog posts I will make a quick review of activities, places, and photographs.
