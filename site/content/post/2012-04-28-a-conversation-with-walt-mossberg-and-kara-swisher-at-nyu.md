On Tuesday I went to New York University for a nice conversation in the <a title="http://www.incnyu.org/internet-garage/" href="http://www.incnyu.org/internet-garage/" target="_blank">Inside the Internet Garage</a> series, with journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher (<a title="http://allthingsd.com/" href="http://allthingsd.com/" target="_blank">AllThingsDigital</a>, Wall Street Journal, etc).

Besides the very interesting bio/background overview of them that the interviewer did, here are some quotes that caught my attention.

Walt Mossberg:

> IT departments are the most regressive force in tech, blocking new tech adoption
> 
> The story goes that Larry Page asked Steve Jobs for advice, he said "Find the 5 things you do best, and focus on it", which it`s what he`s doing
> 
> (Talking about Mark Zuckerberg) "you need some megalomania in order to execute your idea better than others"

Kara Swisher:

> Sergei Brin has always been the goofy one, but Larry Page = Bill Gates. Walt Mossberg adds: ... or like Thomas Jefferson
> 
> Q: Has Google lost its edge? Both answer: No.

After the event, I talked a bit with Mr. Mossberg (quite a character, very determined and smart). The funny/sad anecdote came when I told him: "I`ve been reading you for decades" and he replied: "You don`t look that old". 2 decades and 1 year to be exact. I guess I`m old. My impression of Mrs. Swisher is someone very smart, direct, tough... but humane at the same time.

The beauty of the day? This glitter covered bike I saw walking by SoHo.
