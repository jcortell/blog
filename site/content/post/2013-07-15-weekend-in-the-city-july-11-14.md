The good weather means more outdoors. In NYC it means more &#8220;city&#8221;, but also &#8220;more things going on in the city&#8221;.

This weekend we have walked a lot, and seen quite a few interesting things around town (_caveat_: I am no expert in NY, although Spanish newspaper <a title="http://www.expansion.com/2013/07/05/directivos/1373040713.html" href="http://www.expansion.com/2013/07/05/directivos/1373040713.html" target="_blank">Expansion interviewed me</a> about it last week), like:

  * A Chinese-Spanish cuisine restaurant (no, I have no desire to try it any time soon; there are many others higher on my list)
  * Yoga in Bryant Park
  * A looooooong line of police cars going by
  * The Orly Genger art installation at Madison Sq. Park
  * Carnivorous plants for sale at WholeFoods (is that &#8220;vegetarian&#8221;? &#8220;vegan&#8221;?)
  * Bastille Day at 60th street
  * The march to request justice for Treyvon (if you don&#8217;t understand &#8220;stand your ground&#8221; and the political significance of what&#8217;s at stake, you better <a title="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/03/what-happened-trayvon-martin-explained" href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/03/what-happened-trayvon-martin-explained" target="_blank">start reading now</a>) and to stop the crazy _vigilante_ gun laws being passed all over the USA

It&#8217;s nice to be able to cut through the park to go to a meeting in a nice and quick stroll, instead of having to do a subway transfer.

Or even better to be able to take a walk after dinner, to see the sunset over the Hudson river.
