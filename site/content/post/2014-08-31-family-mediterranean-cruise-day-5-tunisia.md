Knowing that the organized excursion to Tunisia was going to be exhausting, the kids did not come with us, so we had plenty of time to explore La Goulette, Sidi Bou Saïd, and the National Bardo Museum.

There is no doubt Sidi Bou Saïd is picturesque and nice to visit. Clearly Mediterranean in its colors and folklore, it reminds you of the Greek islands or even Ibiza (the old twon).

But what was really impressive was the incredible Roman mosaic collection at <a href="http://www.bardomuseum.tn/" title="http://www.bardomuseum.tn/" target="_blank">the National Bardo Museum</a>. It brought me vivid memories of the archeological expedition I joined 15 years ago in Van, in the border between Turkey, Iran and Iraq.
