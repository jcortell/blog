These past days I&#8217;ve had quite a few meetings and events around London at several lawyers (or _solicitors_, like they&#8217;re called here), and tax and investment advisers&#8217; offices.

Those meetings are important for the future of my company, and I did learn quite a few things, while they help me select the &#8220;super-star team&#8221; that will allow me to take my company to the next level.

But I have also enjoyed running around London, from meeting to meeting, while keeping my eyes (and camera) up in &#8220;tourist mode&#8221;.

I specially like my neighborhood, Southbank, next to the London Bridge, and walking west (towards The Tate Modern and Southbank Centre) and east (towards Tower Bridge).

Because it&#8217;s never just business.
