These past days I`ve had quite a few meetings and events around London at several lawyers (or _solicitors_, like they`re called here), and tax and investment advisers` offices.

Those meetings are important for the future of my company, and I did learn quite a few things, while they help me select the "super-star team" that will allow me to take my company to the next level.

But I have also enjoyed running around London, from meeting to meeting, while keeping my eyes (and camera) up in "tourist mode".

I specially like my neighborhood, Southbank, next to the London Bridge, and walking west (towards The Tate Modern and Southbank Centre) and east (towards Tower Bridge).

Because it`s never just business.
