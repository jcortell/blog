The world around us is full of signs. I won&#8217;t go on dabble about _signifiers_, _meanings_, and the psychoanalitycal importance of the _word_. But sometimes I just can&#8217;t help myself, when I see a sign begging for a creative interpretation:

<img class="aligncenter" title="sign" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-k13TaZts8Oo/Tvub5XYsAiI/AAAAAAAAADA/nELLLfBOJPo/h301/20111228_171722.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="301" />C&#8217;mon, don&#8217;t tell me you don&#8217;t see something like:

> If you press this button, your mouth will become a hotspot

or

> A giant asteroid is heading towards your SpaceInvaders spacecraft, push the button to destroy the asteroid with a Dune-sque voice-blast
