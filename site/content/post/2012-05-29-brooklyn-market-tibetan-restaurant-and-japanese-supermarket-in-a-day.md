Saturday was one action packed day.

First, off to <a title="http://www.brooklynflea.com/markets/" href="http://www.brooklynflea.com/markets/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Flea Market</a> (Fort Greene this time). Sure enough, the subway is a mess like any weekend, but one gets used to it. With a punishing sun, the first thing upon arrival is to hydrate (limenade, although I was tempted to try something they called &#8220;orchata&#8221; which was not, since it was made from coconut and rice), and eat something (palak dosa, and zucchini cheese pupusa&#8230; I missed <a title="http://www.mimiandcoco-ny.com/" href="http://www.mimiandcoco-ny.com/" target="_blank">Mimi&CoCo</a>&#8216;s teriyaki balls or <a title="http://www.theregalvegan.com" href="http://www.theregalvegan.com" target="_blank">TheRegalVegan</a> treats). Then a stroll through tons of vendors (from all kinds of objects made from recycled vinyl, to <a title="http://www.facebook.com/interwovenvintage" href="http://www.facebook.com/interwovenvintage" target="_blank">vintage clothing</a> and antiques, or vinyl records where I heard of the awesome <a title="http://www.themeters.org/" href="http://www.themeters.org/" target="_blank">The Meters</a>) among the crowd, made basically of hipsters and mainly US tourist.

After a while, back to the island, first a stop for some tea at cozy <a title="http://teaspotnyc.com/" href="http://teaspotnyc.com/" target="_blank">The Tea Spot</a>, and then off to have an early dinner at a wonderful Tibetan restaurant called <a title="https://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=tsampa+tibetan+restaurant+nyc&hl=en&cid=14302326278128619425" href="https://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=tsampa+tibetan+restaurant+nyc&hl=en&cid=14302326278128619425" target="_blank">Tsampa</a> (absolutely delicious food, and a nice atmosphere).

But the real &#8220;discovery&#8221; of the day was the Japanese supermarket <a title="https://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=11674644152700205174" href="https://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=11674644152700205174" target="_blank">Sunrise Mart</a>. From Dragon Ball soda to green tea cakes&#8230; they got it all! So I left with a bunch of stuff (Calpico, sanshoku dango, gyokuro tea, kohara uji kintoki, shrimp cup noodles&#8230; even wasabi mame!) and a big smile ^_^
