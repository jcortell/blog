Tonight I went and see <a title="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/film_screenings/14888" href="http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/film_screenings/14888" target="_blank">Tatsumi</a> at the MoMA Film (Theater 2), a 2011 animation film from Singapore, directed by Eric Khoo, with the voice of Yoshihiro Tatsumi (who brought innovation to Japanese comics through works of social commentary aimed at an adult audience in postwar Japan in the late 1950s). _A Drifting Life_, Tatsumi’s epic graphic novel memoir, forms the foundation for the film.

Interesting the unavoidable paralel one can draw between Italy`s neorealism postwar cinema and Tatsumi`s works.
