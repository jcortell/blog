I admit it, there are still great restaurants in Valencia that I have not tried yet. But I am on a mission to change that. 

While <a href="http://www.samsha.es/" title="http://www.samsha.es/" target="_blank">Samsha</a> remains my all-time favorite despite its location, before we flew back to New York we tried the Michelin Guide starred <a href="http://www.elpobletrestaurante.com/" title="http://www.elpobletrestaurante.com/" target="_blank">Poblet restaurant</a>.

I shouldn`t be surprised, since I ate at Quique Dacosta`s El Poblet in Denia a few years ago and knew he was onto something. And while it does not reach the level of inventiveness and fun Samsha reaches (with a fraction of the cost), it is definitely worth the steep price.
