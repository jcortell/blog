Tonight we went to the <a title="https://www.maysongallery.com/" href="https://www.maysongallery.com/" target="_blank">Mayson</a> Gallery inaugural inauguration "Launch" featuring works by Doug Henders, Scott Hewett, Michael Oatman, Jeff Quinn, Bastienne Schmidt, and Rodger Stevens. It was way too crowded to see the works, but it was fun. Particularly because we enjoyed dinner at almost next door <a title="JIN" href="https://jinrestaurantnyc.com/" target="_blank">Jin</a> Japanese restaurant.

But we wish we were at another art inauguration: <a title="IVAM" href="https://www.ivam.es/exposiciones/2881-claudio-zirotti-without-time" target="_blank">IVAM`s Claudio Zirotti</a>.

My dear friend and mentor presents "<a title="https://www.ivam.es/catalogopdf/0588/#/1/" href="https://www.ivam.es/catalogopdf/0588/#/1/" target="_blank">Without Time</a>" (<a title="https://www.ivam.es/catalogopdf/0588/pubData/source/ZIROTTI.pdf" href="https://www.ivam.es/catalogopdf/0588/pubData/source/ZIROTTI.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>), an excellent exhibit of his wonderful art at Valencia`s IVAM Modern Art Institute, until February 19th 2012. Those of you in Valencia, go and enjoy it!
