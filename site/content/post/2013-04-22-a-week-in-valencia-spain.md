After London and Oxford, to finish a great birthday weekend, we went to Valencia (Spain).

We visited family and friends (the whole purpose of the trip) including the studio of <a title="http://zirotticrea.blogspot.com" href="http://zirotticrea.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Claudio Zirotti</a>, went to the office to work more than we wanted to, chose wedding venue, and as always, had a lot of rice dishes.

The anecdote of the trip was on the way out. Once in Madrid, before boarding the Madrid-New York Iberia flight, the &#8220;extra security&#8221; at the gate asked me if I had a flight ticket back to Spain.

â€“ No I don&#8217;t â€“ I replied.

â€“ Then we can&#8217;t let you board the plane.

â€“ WTF??!! I have an office and an apartment in New York, and spend there most of my time. I have entered and exited the country a lot of times. I have had a visa, and I am now traveling with the Visa Waiver Program, I have ESTA authorization&#8230; what is the problem?Â 

â€“ If we let you board that plane without a return ticket we would be fined $6,000. So you either get a return ticket or can&#8217;t board the plane.

At that point I understood there was no point in arguing, and the plane had already started boarding, so there was only one thing left to do: get the damned ticket.

Luckly my travel agent is awesome, and with a laptop, 3G connection via my phone (no WiFi in Barajas MAD airport, thank you), and a credit card, I was able to get a return ticket, and board the plane.

Of course, once I landed, I voided the ticket, and without charge (I told you my travel agent IS awesome). R_ules are mostly made to be broken and are too often for the lazy to hide behind_ (Douglas MacArthur)_Â _ ðŸ˜‰
