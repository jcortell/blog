This weekend we bought our wedding bands. After an extremely special and personal engagement ring, the wedding bands had to be special too!:

MÖBIUS – a Danish design classic. We bought it at <a title="http://www.georgjensen.com/us/?___store=us" href="http://www.georgjensen.com/us/?___store=us" target="_blank">Georg Jensen</a> – 687 Madison Ave., NY.

> The MÖBIUS ring is inspired by geometry, a magnificent example of post-modern innovation. **<a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Möbius_strip" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Möbius_strip" target="_blank">In math, a MÖBIUS is a shape with one surface and one edge (boundary)</a>. It is a fluid, infinite shape that inspires reflection**. Launched in 1968, MÖBIUS is a great example of Georg Jensen design from the mid to late 20th century. They encompass philosophy and beauty, an artistic creation that turns an unusual shape into a stunning piece of jewelry. Inner and outer beauty.

Design Year: 1968

Vivianna Torun Bülow-Hübe (1927 – 2004) was born in Malmö Sweden. She graduated from the Academy of Industrial Arts in Stockholm in 1945 and in 1956 she settled in Paris where she quickly became known for her jewellery. Torun’s designs have become legendary and are exhibited at several museums worldwide including the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  
Torun was philosophical about the role of design in our everyday lives:

> “A piece of jewellery should be a symbol of love. It should enhance and move with the body so that it blends with you. It must not overwhelm, but enhance you. This is why it must be timeless. It shouldn’t matter if you are 17 or 87 years old”
