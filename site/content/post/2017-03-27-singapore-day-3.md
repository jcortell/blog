Tuesday, March 7 in the morning, after breakfast, we checked out of the hotel. But before we boarded the [cruise ship](https://www.crystalcruises.com/asia-cruises/singapore-to-hong-kong--7205), we left the luggage with the hotel’s concierge, and went across the bridge to visit the [National Gallery Singapore](https://www.nationalgallery.sg), which is the only main museum in Singapore I had not yet visited, since it opened in 2015.

It has an interesting Asian art collection, with artist from the late XIX Century like Raden Saleh, to the XX Century like Liu Kang, Nguyen Gia Tri, and contemporaries like Tang Da Wu or Montien Boonma (whose “The Pleasure of Being, Crying, Dying and Eating” was being restored, and it looked better in the glass temporary encaging than when originally created in 1993, and reconstructed in 2015).

After an art-filled afternoon, we boarded [our cruise ship, the Crystal Symphony](https://www.crystalcruises.com/asia-cruises/singapore-to-hong-kong--7205): check-in, unpack, quick and delicious lunch, and left again for a night in town. This time we decided to have the [iconic Sling cocktail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Sling) (mine a virgin one, thanks) at The Raffles Hotel, probably the only place in Singapore where you can throw your peanut shells onto the floor. Tradition is tradition.

To end another wonderful day, we had dinner at Michelin-star dim sum place [TimHoWan](https://www.timhowan.com/country/singapore/).
