Thursday, March 16, was a day at sea. I spent most of it working (blessed be laptops and satellite internet connection), reading (Scientific American, The Economist, The London Review of Books, etc) and resting, trying to get rid of the fever I caught in Saigon. I must have been really sick when I did not even feel like taking a single picture! 🙂

But we also attended a cooking demonstration (involving liquid nitrogen) by Guest Chef Steven Chou, and a couple of lectures, one by Tim Wade on “Chan May and Sanya” and another one by Prof. Judith Fordham (Australian criminal lawyer and expert in forensic science) titled “The Real CSI: Truth is Stranger than Fiction”.

At night we watched Martin Scorsese’s “Snowden”. Another excellent movie, along with Laura Poitras’ documentary, about one of my heroes.
