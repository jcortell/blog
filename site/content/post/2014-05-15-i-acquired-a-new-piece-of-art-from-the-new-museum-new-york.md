For my wife&#8217;s birthday I acquired a piece of art from <a title="http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/pawel-althamer" href="http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/pawel-althamer" target="_blank">Paweł Althamer&#8217;s &#8220;The Neighbors&#8221;</a>, which run through April 13 at the New Museum in New York city.

> Since the early 1990s, Althamer (b. 1967 Warsaw, Poland) has established a unique artistic practice featuring an expanded approach to sculptural representation and consistently experimental models of social collaboration.

It was great to discuss with a museum curator which piece to select (we agreed without a doubt), and it&#8217;s a pleasure to have this piece in the living room of our Chelsea apartment.

To celebrate it we had dinner nearby, at Daniel Boulud&#8217;s excellent (although mainly carnivore) <a title="http://www.dbgb.com/nyc/" href="http://www.dbgb.com/nyc/" target="_blank">DBGB</a> &#8220;gastro pub&#8221;.
