This post will be updated after the talk with feedback, pictures, and hopefully a video recording of it.

In the meantime, [here are the slides in PDF format](https://res.cloudinary.com/jcortell/image/upload/v1579823972/Personal/MIT__IDE_Narrative.pdf) (note: they only serve as "illustration" of things I will comment).
