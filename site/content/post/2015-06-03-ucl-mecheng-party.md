Yesterday Mykal invited me to the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/students/052015/052015-01052015-ucl-mecheng-to-host-summer-session" target="_blank">University College London’s Mechanical Engineering Summer Session at Student Central</a>.

It was a blast. A geek blast. Many featured projects, such as giant drone, hydrogen racing car prototype, alternative transportation infrastructure, robotic fish, or improved artificial heart valve design, along with entertainment: giant Scalextric racing, giant jinga, FIFA 15 tournament, impact simulators, pool, and a live concert by Cable Street Collective.

[Note: Congratulations on launching the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0515/270515-ucl-press#sthash.kQIw0GG9.dpuf" target="_blank">UK’s first fully Open Access university press</a>!!]

On my way home, a nice walk (although it’s still quite cold), I took some pictures of St. Paul’s Cathedral and the Millennium bridge, and enjoyed how quiet the streets get even before sunset.
