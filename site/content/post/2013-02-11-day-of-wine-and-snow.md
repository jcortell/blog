February 9th was truly a day of wine and snow.

A big snowfall came down the night before, leaving the [pretty pictures](http://robinlangsdorf.com/new-blog/2013/2/11/winter-wonderland-weekend-nyc "http://robinlangsdorf.com/new-blog/2013/2/11/winter-wonderland-weekend-nyc") we have all seen in the media, along with 6,000 cancelled flights and 400,000 homes without power in the Boston area.

So I had no plans to get out of my comfortable Chelsea apartment, but Jill (a friend who works at the New York Times, and who is moving to Washington DC to head the DC Bureau of the NYT) invited us to the <a title="http://nywinefestivals.com" href="http://nywinefestivals.com" target="_blank">NYC Winter Wine Fest</a>.

Held in a Broadway theater, it is an interesting event: a set of tables where you could taste a <a title="http://nywinefestivals.com/Wine_List_Winter_Wine_2013.html" href="http://nywinefestivals.com/Wine_List_Winter_Wine_2013.html" target="_blank">very large list of different wines</a>, some food and live music (<a title="http://www.jeffgolub.com/" href="http://www.jeffgolub.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Golub</a>). We tried quite a few wines. The ones we marked in our booklet as the ones we liked best (in bold the most original and favorites):

  * Mural Douro Red 2007 Douro Reserva (Portugal)
  * **Marques de Murrieta Capellania White Reserva 2006 La Rioja (Spain)**
  * Comenge Bodegas y Vi√±edos Ribera del Duero 2006 (Spain)
  * **Finca El Origen Torrontes Reserva (Argentina)**
  * Chateau D`Aussieres Blason D`Aussieres Corbieres 2008 (France)
  * Chateau de Campuget Prestige Red 2007 (France)
  * **Dr. Konstantin Frank Rkatsiteli 2010 (NY)**
  * Dr. Konstantin Frank Riesling Dry 2011 (NY)
  * **Goldsmith Sauvignon Blanc (New Zealand)**
  * Runnymede Sauvignon Blanc 2011 Stitch (New Zealand)

After that, we headed to <a title="http://www.xaixaiwinebar.com" href="http://www.xaixaiwinebar.com" target="_blank">Xai Xai</a> to end the evening with a nice conversation and an excellent octopus and eggplant stuffed with goat cheese. Good luck, Jill!
