These past 10 days I have been acting as a Cicerone for my sister and her partner. We really enjoyed having them in our Chelsea apartment. It was also a great opportunity to see NY from the eyes of a tourist again, which I sometimes fail to do since I have been living here for 3 years now.

There are a ton of anecdotes and discoveries behind these pictures, but you have to come to New York to experience them ðŸ˜‰
