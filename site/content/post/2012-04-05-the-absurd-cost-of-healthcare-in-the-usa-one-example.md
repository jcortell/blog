There is a lot of debate and analysis on why is the US healthcare system so freakingly expensive (basic answer: greedy inhuman and short sighted powerful economic interest added to puppet politicians and sheepish voters). Here is one real life example: a friend in Atlanta told me that he went to the hospital ER after feeling intense chest pain. He knew it was most likely a strong episode of acid reflux (he had been suffering from that for some time), but it was so severe, he got scared and wanted to check.

After the preliminary doctor`s visit, it seemed to be just acid reflux, but **_just in case_ (out fear of malpractice rather than extra care for the patient, as admitted by the doctor)**, an <a title="http://choosingwisely.org/" href="http://choosingwisely.org/" target="_blank">extensive battery of test</a> was ordered. After those, he was sent home. BUT...

**Although he has full insurance (which in this country, as I am finding out, is not at all cheap), he still had to pay a bill of $12,000 (and assumes his insurance has covered around $80,000). WTF!!!!**
