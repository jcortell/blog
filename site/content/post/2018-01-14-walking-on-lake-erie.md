Today we went walking on Lake Erie.

<!--more-->

It does not happen often, but once in a while, [Lake Erie freezes](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=91552)  completely. Since we live right on the lake, we decided to walk on it.

We were really careful, as there have been recent reports of people having to be [rescued](http://wivb.com/2018/01/14/6-ice-fishermen-rescued-from-lake-erie/) and even [dissapearing](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/missing-man-fell-through-lake-erie-ice-say-monroe-county-police-1.4483108).

The "miracle" was not that we walked on the lake, exploring its amazing [ice waves, caves, and strange formations](http://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2016/01/20/cleveland-lake-erie-frozen-waves-pkg.wews). The miracle is that, at -8°F (-22°C) we did not catch a cold ;-)
