On Saturday I went to <a title="https://www.thearmoryshow.com/" href="https://www.thearmoryshow.com/" target="_blank">The Armory Show 2012</a>. So many galleries, so little time.Â 

While everybody was talking aboutÂ Marina Abramovicâ€™s _Bed for Human UseÂ _performance,Â Theaster Gates`Â commissionedÂ Pier 94 cafÃ© piece, orÂ Michael Riedelâ€™s installation at New Yorkâ€™s David Zwirnerâ€™s booth (forget about the Nordic spaces)... I found other works much much more interesting. But that`s what makes art`s subjectivity (apparently not so subjective)Â so appealing.

Although, for the first time I found myself (and was ment to be that way) inside a piece of exhibited art by <a title="https://www.pistoletto.it/eng/crono.htm" href="https://www.pistoletto.it/eng/crono.htm" target="_blank">Michelangelo Pistoletto</a> at <a title="https://www.galleriacontinua.com/english/artista.html?id_artista=19&s=opere" href="https://www.galleriacontinua.com/english/artista.html?id_artista=19&s=opere" target="_blank">Galleria Continua</a>â€˜s booth (I am not showing it here because it will soon be published in a book). Cool!

Of course, who can resist the temptation to leave such a show withoutÂ acquiring some art? So I got a piece (actually 3) from the amusingly critical <a title="https://www.jenniferdalton.com/" href="https://www.jenniferdalton.com/" target="_blank">Jennifer Dalton</a> at <a title="https://www.winkleman.com/artist/view/759" href="https://www.winkleman.com/artist/view/759" target="_blank">Winkleman Gallery</a>, and also a print titled "<a title="https://christianandersen.net/index.php?/press-release/press-release-lina-viste-gronli/" href="https://christianandersen.net/index.php?/press-release/press-release-lina-viste-gronli/" target="_blank">Phil Collins in Eurythmics</a>" (2012) by <a title="https://www.linavistegroenli.com/" href="https://www.linavistegroenli.com/" target="_blank">Lina Viste GrÃ¸nli</a>. Which makes you wonder why do we have the need toÂ possessÂ (wether the object, the picture or even the memory)?

I could write a book (many in fact) about the inspiration, sensations, and thoughts that emanate from such overexposure to art, but that was only Saturday and the weekend was not even over and I had a lot more art waiting around the corner... ðŸ˜‰
