Everybody is too busy. It’s the “toxic work world” we live in, <a href="https://t.co/vaj62P1mHg" target="_blank">according</a> to the New York Times. But some days are more ridiculously packed than others.
  
Last week I had so many meetings, it was hard for me to keep track of them. Some that I remember off the top of my head: meeting with a General Partner of Google Ventures, meeting two executives from the National Health Service (NHS), an executive from Accenture at their posh London offices, being interviewed by an Editor from The Times, being picked up by a driver in a hybrid car with wifi who took me to a media event (Haymarket Group’s Create 2015) to present and participate in a panel along two other accomplished “entrepreneurs” from TechHub, and minutes later participating at another event (Connected Health) at Simmons & Simmons.

That kind of manic schedule is only possible in high density/concentration areas such as New York, Silicon Valley, or London. And that’s why when other areas in the world try to “replicate Silicon Valley”, they forget the main “ingredient”: critical mass.
