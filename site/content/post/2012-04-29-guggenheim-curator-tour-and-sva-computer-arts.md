On Friday, at lunch time, I went to the Guggenheim to meet Susan Thompson, Curatorial Assistant, for a tour of [Francesca Woodman](https://www.guggenheim.org/woodman) exhibition.

Although Francesca Woodman`s photographs are undeniably subtle and portray the mind of a troubled young woman (body, space, self, disgust, identity, etc), it is a pity she took her life so early, leaving us with what is obviously a truncated body of work, one that begins, explores, promises... but never concludes because death found her first.

What really annoyed me was the curator`s unwillingness (I refuse to believe she "did not have more information" as she said) to talk about Woodman`s suicide. So I asked her directly, and she still dodged the question. Why is suicide such a taboo, even today?

So, after taking the opportunity and seeing <a title="https://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/john-chamberlain-choices" href="https://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/john-chamberlain-choices" target="_blank">John Chamberlain <em>choices</em></a> <a title="https://web.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/chamberlain/" href="https://web.guggenheim.org/exhibitions/chamberlain/" target="_blank">exhibition</a> (walking by Natalie Portman for the second time that day, as she took a walk with a friend, stroller and baby) and enjoying more than anticipated, in sharp contrast with the apathy the <a title="https://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/being-singular-plural" href="https://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/being-singular-plural" target="_blank"><em>Being Singular Plural</em> exhibition</a> provoked upon exploration, I headed to the School of Visual Arts for their MFA Computer Art Open Studios.

  In short: unorganized, uncreative... not worth it.
