On Sunday I went to the <a title="https://www.newmuseum.org/events/636" href="https://www.newmuseum.org/events/636" target="_blank">Independent Art Spaces Symposium and Art Spaces Directory Launch</a> at the New Museum.

<img class="aligncenter" title="event picture" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-aV1oi20wY74/T3iD_xbRIZI/AAAAAAAABBo/wz_UOWu9jWs/w500-h375-k/20120331_121544.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />

I purchased the Art Spaces Directory last week, and I believe it is an excellent work, useful informative, needed. But the symposium was... sad, to say the least: a bunch of gallery (art-spaces) curators, unable to play a PowerPoint (sic... makes me sick), and regurgitating exhibit picture after exhibit picture while vomiting names after names of artists, collectives and the like. No real info, no insight, no philosophy, no debate, no... nothing. Art today?
