Day 5 started with a presentation of MIT&#8217;s eMBA and the REAP program.

After that, lectures by [William Aulet](http://executive.mit.edu/faculty/profile/58-william-aulet), [Scott Keating](http://executive.mit.edu/faculty/profile/132-scott-keating), [Paul Maeder](http://executive.mit.edu/faculty/profile/285-paul-maeder), and [Antoinette Schoar](http://executive.mit.edu/faculty/profile/68-antoinette-schoar).[

And then&#8230; an all-nighter preparing the group project. Tension, stress, frustration, but in the end a great feeling of accomplishment, and pride in a job well done.
