Our second day onboard the Windstar Star Breeze cruise took us to Amalfi (Italy).

<!--more-->

Thursday, August 31st was our second day in our "Classic Italy & Dalmatian Coast" cruise.

We sailed past Napoli, Mount Vesuvius, Sorrento, Capri, and Positano, and we anchored right in front of Amalfi at 8am. 

After breakfast we took the tender ashore, and right off the pier, at the Spiaggia Grande, we were picked up by the shuttle of a hotel we wanted to inspect: the Santa Caterina, located nearby, next to Pastena.

After enjoying a tour of the fantastic hotel, and a lemon drink with a view in their 'out of a movie' terrace, we went back to Amalfi town to walk up and down via Lorenzo d'Amalfi, before taking the tender back to the ship.

We had lunch in a rush, because we wanted to enjoy the water sports platform as much as possible.

The kayaks and boats has already been put away, but we were able to climb up the giant bouncy platform and slide. Swimming in the Mediterranean is something I can never get tired of.

After our swim, we departed towards our next port of call (Giardini Naxos) at 4pm, which gave us some time to be able to work in our state room. 

Internet speeds on a cruise ship are never blazing fast, but this one was the slowest I have ever suffered. I could even hear the 56k modem making its funny little hand-shake noises in my head!

We ended the day with another delicious dinner and watching the movie 'Stranger than fiction'.
