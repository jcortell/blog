On Friday, May 1, our bodies finally caught up with all the pre-cruise accumulated stress, by sleeping until 1pm, taking into account the time change. So we headed straight to lunch (“would you like some coffee with your steak and kidney pie, dear?”), followed by a very nice walk around the deck.

After the afternoon tea we worked with our laptops in the Library. My wife decided to go back to the room early, so she could get ready for the formal dinner and Masquerade Ball, while sipping rosé champagne. I stayed and worked a bit more, until it was time to go back to the room, to change into my dark suit and tie, and the hand made Venetian masks we bought this summer in Italy, specially for this occasion.

Dinner was delicious, but the Masquerade Ball was even more. It was a delight to see so many people in the spirit of the event, with their fabulous masks (for the most part). It was also interesting to see the concept of “mask” some people have. From “robbers and cops” or “phantom of the opera” fantasies for most of the gents, to lots of feathers and glitter for most of the ladies, not that many people chose our interpretation of it: Venetian Masquerade Ball.

All in all a fabulous night, while a sad reminder that the cruise was nearing its end.
