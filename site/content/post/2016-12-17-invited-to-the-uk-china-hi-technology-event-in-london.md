For reasons beyond the scope of this post I was invited to participate in the [UK-China Hi! Technology](https://www.cocoon-networks.com/in-the-press/inaugural-china-uk-hi-technology-festival-marks-launch-of-innovation-centre/) event in London.

The event was well attended by a large number of entrepreneurs, funds and investors from the UK and China.

The highlight of the event, for me, other than a couple of really interesting contacts, was to see all these suited-up people lining up to try the VR sets (HTC, Oculus, Hololens, etc). The clear winner was Robot Recall for the Oculus platform.
