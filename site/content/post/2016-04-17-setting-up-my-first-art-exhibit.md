The weekend of February 27 and 28 I set up my first art exhibition as Independent International Art Curator.

In collaboration with the <a href="https://internetfreedomfestival.org/" target="_blank">Internet Freedom Festival</a>, held in Las Naves (Valencia) from 2 to 6 March, <a href="https://netfreedomart.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Net Freedom Art Show</a> is an international, itinerant, collective and multidisciplinary contemporary art show. After its debut in Valencia, it will be exhibited in galleries around the world (New York, London, Santiago de Chile, and Kaunas).

In this exhibition, I have collected works by Carlos Motta (Colombia), Pawel Althamer (Poland), Osamu Tezuka (Japan), Dave Cicirelli (USA), Patricija Gilyte (Lithuania), Claudio Zirotti (Italy), Mery (Spain), and Paulina Vassileva (Bulgary).

Most of the works come from private collections, acquired in museums like the Guggenheim and the New Museum in New York. Others have been donated by the artists, having been exhibited in places like the Tate Modern in London, MoMA in New York, or Art Basel.

With this provocative, irreverent, atypical exhibition I intend to provoke the viewer to think about some of the focal points of the struggle for freedom online, such as Community, Gender, Diversity, Media, Technology, Best Practices, Design, and Politics. In this sense, all the works integrate multiple messages, including the heterogeneous group of selected artists representing the diverse nature of the Internet.

Hope you like it.
