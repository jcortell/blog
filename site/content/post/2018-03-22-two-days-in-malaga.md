After an unexpected delay, I spent a couple days in Malaga.

<!--more-->

March 22nd I went to Malaga (Spain) with a few colleagues from Kanteron. The high-speed train is awesome, and almost always on time. Almost.

This time the train had to be towed from Cordoba, which meant a delay of a couple of hours. And while that meant that we got our money back, it also meant I missed my appointment, so I had to stay overnight.

At least I did take a walk downtown, and had dinner at my favorite tea shop: [La Teteria](https://www.la-teteria.com/), next to the Cathedral and the Picasso Museum.
