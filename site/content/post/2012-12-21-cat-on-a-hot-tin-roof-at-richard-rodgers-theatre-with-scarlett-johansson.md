On Wednesday StephanieÂ [thank you!] invited me to see "<a title="https://www.catonahottinroofbroadway.com/" href="https://www.catonahottinroofbroadway.com/" target="_blank">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a>" at Richard Rodgers Theatre (Broadway, New York) with Scarlett Johansson.

Although I had seen the movie, perhaps because I was too young to understand, or perhaps because in the movie the plot is not as clear, the truth is that I enjoyed and understood Tennessee Williams` play much better this time. And it has a much broader appeal than what I initially guessed (being a _Southern Gothic_ work). Big and close families that are not really that close, patriarchies, lies, deceit, lack of communication, expectations, despair, neglet, denial... who hasn`t been there?

Scenography was perfect. Benjamin Walker`s performance as the handsome _Brick_ is consistent, but I would say it is too influenced by Marlon Brandon`s movie rendition. Scarlett Johansson does a pretty good job as _Maggie_, although she does not steal the show. As a matter of fact, the whole cast does such a great job, that there are no "stars". It just works (which, in Broadway, is a very nice result).
