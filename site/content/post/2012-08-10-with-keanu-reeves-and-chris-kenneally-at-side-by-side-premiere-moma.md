  Yesterday I was invited to the premiere of Keanu Reeves and Chris Kenneally&#8217;s documentary &#8220;<a title="http://sidebysidethemovie.com" href="http://sidebysidethemovie.com" target="_blank">Side by side</a>&#8221; at MoMA. Beyond the star-appeal of an amazing roster of artists and celebrities appearing on the film, and its obvious educational value (every film lover should go and see it, and see &#8220;the real person behind the myth&#8221; in many cases), I really liked the after-movie talk with Chris and Keanu. They not only love film, and did an excellent job showing a &#8220;balanced&#8221; view of the debate between <em>celluloid vs. digital</em>, but did venture into three other areas that I found fascinating:
</p>

  * The first one was the archiving and preservation of film. While an interesting debate by itself, it is not as important as it seemed to them, since, as I see it, technology will catch up and surpass the needs and expectations in a matter of very few years. Although a lot could be said about culture, preservation, archiving, formats, etc. Which leads us to&#8230;
  * The second one: it was a very brief moment, when upon the comment &#8220;somebody has to be the taste maker&#8221; by one of the producers being interviewed, Keanu, as interviewer said &#8220;wow&#8221;. He did not make many comments afterwards, but he repeated &#8220;wow&#8221; and &#8220;it leaves you thinking&#8221; and &#8220;really??&#8221;. And that &#8220;industry&#8221; position of gate-keepers and the surprise it causes among artist, intellectuals and general public, it worth a very lengthy debate.
  * The third one was only hinted at, but it has a major significance: rather than nostalgic celluloid die-hards versus digital film visionaries (one can only admire George Lucas&#8217; determination), it is the new technology, early adopters, explorers of new ways, versus the scared, controlling, and anachronic _status quo_.

<p style="text-align: left">
  And one thing that I wish they considered, and did not have time to propose: free all that &#8220;extra&#8221; material (they interviewed 140 people, and only show 70 in the fim), let people see it, download it, commment it, tag it, organize it, transcribe it&#8230; it is very valuable and it would not diminish your return on investment. If anything, as we all know, it would increase promotion and awareness, which it means higher revenues&#8230; But then again, you would do it for the love of film, wouldn&#8217;t you?
