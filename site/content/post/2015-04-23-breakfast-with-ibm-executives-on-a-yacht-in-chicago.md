On April 14th I was invited to have breakfast with IBM executives on a private yacht (with a helicopter on the stern) in Chicago.

It was a unique opportunity to discuss the future of healthcare and technology, and my company, with the most senior executives in the company, in a very beautiful setting.

Thank you!
