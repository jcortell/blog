Tuesday September 13 was a day devoted to workshops, a policy hackathon, and a visit to Pinterest HQ.

As I have mentioned before, we have been fortunate to have a great group of mentors. In this case we enjoyed the following sessions in small groups:

  * _Market growth_ with: the CEO of CorkBIC, a former Microsoft BizDev VP, and the co-Founder & Director of Blippar
  * _Funding_ with: the Chair of Global Venture Forum, a Director at Woodside Capital, and a Partner at Delta Partners Group
  * _M&A/IPO_ with: the Principal M&A Integration at Google, a Managing Partner at Woodside Capital, and a Partner at Penningtons Manches
  * _Communication/PR_ with: the President of ActiveMedia, and the Associate Director at Oxygen PR

After that we had a policy hackathon competition (more about that in the next blog post).

To top the, yet again intense day, we went to visit Pinterest`s HQ.
