Today we have gone to the <a title="http://independentnewyork.com" href="http://independentnewyork.com" target="_blank">Independent</a> art show at <a title="http://www.center548.com" href="http://www.center548.com" target="_blank">Center 548</a>. Two floors (starts in the second floor, and the roof top only has a bar). The second floor has some, very few, interesting works. The third floor? Don&#8217;t even bother. From childish to improvised, without even being _outsider_ or _brut_.

When I go to art shows like this I exit with a strange happy grin. The reason? I realize I still have a personal taste, and I know what I don&#8217;t like, no matter how crowded the space is, or if it is in Chelsea.

Why does everybody in the &#8220;art world&#8221; have to bite their tongue and think that the worst thing they can say about a show or artists is &#8220;interesting&#8221;? Why are we SO afraid of subjectivity? Why the need for objective methodology upon the lack of which we chicken back to &#8220;everything is good&#8221;? Be brave! Be discerning! Have criteria! Sure, research, learn, base your choices on something other than the worn out &#8220;gut feeling&#8221; or &#8220;emotional aspect of the impact&#8221;. But _for the love of God_ (pun intended), be you!
