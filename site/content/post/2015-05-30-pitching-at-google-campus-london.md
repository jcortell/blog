On Tuesday I introduced my company officially to the Google Campus London community, with a &#8220;pitch&#8221;.

It didn&#8217;t surprise me to see the relaxed &#8220;cool startup&#8221; vibe, or the fact that it was full of entrepreneurs. What surprised me is how much people liked my pitch. I ran out of business cards!

It was interesting to hear what those entrepreneurs are working on: from a Polish working on &#8220;on-demand concierge services&#8221;, to a Russian with &#8220;personality analysis applied to finances&#8221;, or an Egyptian/Spanish couple working on &#8220;social-selling fashion&#8221;. The best part was being able to help a young British engineer and his interesting startup with ideas on how to focus his target market.

I guess concentration (co-workings, accelerators, hubs, etc) has its problems and defects, but without a doubt it also has advantages, like meeting people with interesting projects every time you turn a corner.
