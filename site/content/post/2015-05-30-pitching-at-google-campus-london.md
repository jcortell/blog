On Tuesday I introduced my company officially to the Google Campus London community, with a "pitch".

It didn`t surprise me to see the relaxed "cool startup" vibe, or the fact that it was full of entrepreneurs. What surprised me is how much people liked my pitch. I ran out of business cards!

It was interesting to hear what those entrepreneurs are working on: from a Polish working on "on-demand concierge services", to a Russian with "personality analysis applied to finances", or an Egyptian/Spanish couple working on "social-selling fashion". The best part was being able to help a young British engineer and his interesting startup with ideas on how to focus his target market.

I guess concentration (co-workings, accelerators, hubs, etc) has its problems and defects, but without a doubt it also has advantages, like meeting people with interesting projects every time you turn a corner.
