On Friday I attended the <a href="http://britishartfair.co.uk/" target="_blank">20/21 British Art Fair</a> at the Royal College of Art, in London.

Usually I love art fairs, and find many exciting works of art. I particularly love the creative energy you can feel at contemporary art fairs.

This one was not an exciting fair. Perhaps because it is modern and contemporary, perhaps because it is limited to British artists, or perhaps because this yearâ€™s selection was not that interesting. In any case, I am thankful for the invitation, but it definitely not cause a positive impact.
