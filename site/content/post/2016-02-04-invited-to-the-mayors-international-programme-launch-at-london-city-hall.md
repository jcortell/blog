Yesterday I was invited to attend the official launch of the <a href="http://gotogrow.london/" target="_blank">Mayor’s International Programme</a> at City Hall, London, where I met some of London&#8217;s top entrepreneurs, mentors, and the Mayor (who gave a short speech using 007 as a reference).

One of my companies (Kanteron Systems) has been selected as one of the 35 companies forming the initial cohort.

The programme will support high growth businesses from London’s Technology, Life Sciences and Urban sectors to expand their businesses internationally. It is run by London & Partners (supported by the Mayor), partly funded by the European Development Fund and partly by five private sector delivery partners: BDO, Benoy, KPMG, London Chamber of Commerce and Industry & PA Consulting. As members, we will select mentoring, business opportunities, workshops and overseas missions.
