Since I have been a few weeks without being able to post anything for several reasons (health, family, work, blog migration&#8230;), I am going to catch up &#8220;all at once&#8221;, writing in a couple of posts two month&#8217;s worth of activity.

February 23 to 26 my wife and I attended the healthcare tech trade show HIMSS, in Orlando, FL (USA).

We got a huge room at the Marriott Royal Palms, but we could not enjoy the city much due to work. Although the dinners at Hemingway&#8217;s and Citrus, and the pool side party at the Westin Orlando we attended invited by Accenture, were totally worth it.

I was in San Diego, California (USA) only March 3rd and 4th, to attend the USCAP trade show. Nothing remarkable. I stayed at the Bristol, I like the &#8220;eco&#8221; supermarket Jimbo&#8217;s Naturally, and took a walk thought the Gas Lamp District.

March 6 I travelled to Fort Worth, Texas (EE. UU.).

March 17 to 21 is was in Bogota (Colombia). I stayed at the AR Salitre Hotel, excellent views, enjoyed the great French restaurant at the Los Nogales Country Club, and the extremely typical (but genuine) Chibchombia Colombian restaurant. On my return trip, I had to spend several hours at the airport&#8217;s VIP lounge due to flight delays, which allowed me meet several interesting personalities (business, entertainers, politicians, actresses&#8230;).
