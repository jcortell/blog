Last Saturday I went to the MET for the symposium "<a title="http://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/symposia/michelangelo-1" href="http://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/lectures-and-panels/symposia/michelangelo-1" target="_blank">Michelangelo and His World in the 1490s</a>". Presented by some of the most distinguished Michelangelo`s scholars, there was a lot of in-depth info on this very exceptional artist. Here are some of the most curious trivia I learned:

  * He was an exceptional painter and art forger from a very early age (when he was 12 years old he forged and smoked to make it look old, church paintings) and that`s why his father enrolled in an art studio at 13, even though the minimum age was 14.
  * He had an "art factory" (sorry, Andy or Damian, he was there first), designing and sometimes drawing "blockbusters" which were later drawn in 20 or 30 copy or version runs.
  * He was the first to depart from "realism" in color: he often painted "blocks of color", for strength and dramatic effect.

I networked a bit to discuss some scholarly work I am doing on Michelangelo (more on that in a few months) and then went to the subway. On the way there I found a church, with a quote I always considered interesting beyond the obvious reasons (food for thought):

> God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.

I like to contrast it with this other quote:

> We must accept that which we can not change, and change that which we can not accept.

So I went to <a title="http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/" href="http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/" target="_blank">Madison Square park</a>. Across the street, Worth Square, there are a ton of food stands (<a title="http://www.madparknews.com/madison-square-park-restaurants/madison-square-eats-spring-2012/" href="http://www.madparknews.com/madison-square-park-restaurants/madison-square-eats-spring-2012/" target="_blank">Madison Square Eats</a>, until June 1st), one of the many <a title="http://www.newyorkled.com/nyc_events_Street_Fairs.htm" href="http://www.newyorkled.com/nyc_events_Street_Fairs.htm" target="_blank">NY Street Festivals</a> that show up everywhere with the wonderful weather we are enjoying right now. I grabbed some arancini and casatta (the lobster roll and canoli will be next), headed for the park and enjoyed the meal al fresco with squirrels all around.
