May 21st (sorry that is taking me so long to write posts, but unlike what this blog seems to convey, I also do work. A lot) I was invited to aÂ <a title="http://www.councilofprotocolexecutives.org" href="http://www.councilofprotocolexecutives.org" target="_blank">Council Of Protocol Executives</a> event India House, New York.

It was a wonderful mix of C-level executives from all kinds of industries (healthcare, advertising, travel, banking&#8230;). A great networking opportunity, with delicious food (seafood risotto, truffle and porcini ricotta, fried oysters, choclate covered strawberries&#8230;).

The India House itself is a little run down, and not my style. But if you want an uncrowded cozy and cute little bar in the financial district, do not miss their Blue Bar.
