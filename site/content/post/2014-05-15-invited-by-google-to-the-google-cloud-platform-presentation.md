March 25 Google NY invited me to their <a title="https://cloud.google.com" href="https://cloud.google.com" target="_blank">Google Cloud Platform</a> presentation in their Chelsea offices, 8 blocks away from my apartment.

Besides the interesting new features (<a title="https://cloud.google.com/events/google-cloud-platform-live/" href="https://cloud.google.com/events/google-cloud-platform-live/" target="_blank">here are the videos</a>), and the delicious and healthy lunch buffet, I networked quite a lot, and had a few laughs about the highest concentration of Google Glasses per person I have seen so far. One thing is clear: genomics, which is one of the main things my two companies deal with, and the cloud, are closely related, and they will be even more in the near future.
