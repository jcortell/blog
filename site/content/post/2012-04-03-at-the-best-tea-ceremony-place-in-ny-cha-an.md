On Sunday I went to <a title="http://www.chaanteahouse.com/" href="http://www.chaanteahouse.com/" target="_blank">Cha-an</a>. In short: a cute japanese restaurant, good food, excellent desserts, and what seems to be the best Japanese Tea Ceremony in NY (ate there, but will have to do the ceremony some other day). Definitely to the "must" list.
