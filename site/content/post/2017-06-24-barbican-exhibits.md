Last Saturday, June 17, we visited a couple of exhibitions we were really interested in:  

**Into the Unknown**

[Into the Unknown](https://www.barbican.org.uk/intotheunknown/) is "a genre-defining exhibition of art, design, film and literature" revolving around science-fiction.

**The Japanese House**

[The Japanese House](https://www.barbican.org.uk/artgallery/event-detail.asp?ID=19951) "is the centrepiece of the UKâ€™s first major exhibition exploring Japanese domestic architecture from the end of the Second World War". A must see.

We enjoyed both tremendously and recommend anyone in London to go see them.
