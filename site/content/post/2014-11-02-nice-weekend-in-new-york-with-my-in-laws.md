Three weeks ago I enjoyed a nice week at home in New York. My in-laws came to visit from Canada, and my wife took the opportunity to try new recipes using some very fresh ingredients bought in the weekend-only Farmer&#8217;s Market just around the corner, on 23rd st in Chelsea. Despite being small, they seem to carry everything, even &#8220;tea champagne&#8221; (fermented kombucha with ginger).

From polenta with swiss chards and mushrooms, to homemade apple pie (New Yorkers know their apples: whenever you can, try the &#8220;honey crisp&#8221;, you won&#8217;t regret it), it&#8217;s a real pleasure to enjoy such delicious and healthy dishes.

Taking advantage of the last days of nice weather we also went to the American Museum of Natural History, in Manhattan&#8217;s Upper West Side. I never get tired of that museum, and always learn new things there. This time the most shocking display allowed us to look at a recent extinction in the face: &#8220;Lonesome George&#8221;, the last tortoise of its species, from Galapagos, was in display as a reminder of the number of species that we are destroying in our blind rush of unsustainable consumerism.

I also discovered the inspiring words of Theodore Roosevelt inscribed at the entrance of the museum. I especially liked the &#8220;Manhood&#8221; one (see photo).
