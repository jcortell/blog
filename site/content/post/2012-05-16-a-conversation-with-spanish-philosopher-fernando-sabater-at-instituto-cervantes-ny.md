Wednesday May 2nd, I had the pleasure to meet <a title="http://www.savater.org/" href="http://www.savater.org/" target="_blank">Fernando Sabater</a> at <a title="http://nyork.cervantes.es" href="http://nyork.cervantes.es" target="_blank">Instituto Cervantes, NY</a>.

The conversation was lighthearted and included many anecdotes and trvia, but also a good dose of Philosophy and Psychology wisdom and aphorisms (like those by <a title="http://www.andresneuman.com/contenido_libros.php?id=23" href="http://www.andresneuman.com/contenido_libros.php?id=23" target="_blank">Andrés Newman</a>). Here are some delicious quotes by him:

>   * Don&#8217;t attack, don&#8217;t comply
>   * Childhood is always bad: wether because it was bad and left you a trauma, or because it was good and it frustrates you to leave it behind
>   * Happyness is also hard to bear
>   * Skepticism grows, and that&#8217;s why when I am about to make a statement (particularly if it is a grand one) I end up laughing. That&#8217;s why although I was going to become a great philoshoper, I ended up a simple professor
>   * The difficulty of leaving the pack
>   * I don&#8217;t have arguments to support good things&#8230; just try them!
>   * One phylosophizes in order not to stop asking questions
>   * Do not be shy on contradictions

And others quoted by him:

> We live dramatically in a non-dramatic world

Santayana

> Tell me the lie you consider more worthy of being true

_Mon Faust_ (Paul Valéry)

> If the young knew and the old could!

Old French proverb

> Patent portas

Wrongly attributed by him to Epictetus (it is actually by Marcus Tullius Cicero)

> Things are changing so much, I don&#8217;t even know if I&#8217;m on our side anymore

Anonymous quote after the Spanish Civil War

> The difference between a civilized and a barbaric man is that the civilized man is willing to die for that in which he does not completely believes in

Isaiah Berlin

> I know Paris &#8220;with Poe, in a dream&#8221;

Lovecraft (&#8230; but Poe had never been to Paris either!)

> I propose to add to the Fundamental Bill of Rights: a right to contradict oneself, and a right to leave

Baudelaire

So, at the end of his talk, and since he had translated some of E. M. Cioran&#8217;s work and knew him personally, I asked him one question about the Romanian philosopher that has haunted me for decades: given his line of thought, why didn&#8217;t Cioran kill himself?

Sabater explained to me that he himself tried to be more of a nihilist and negativist in his early twenties, but Cioran told him: you do not look like a nihilist, with that body. And answering my question, Sabater told me how Cioran knew he could always kill himself, so he always left it for another day.
