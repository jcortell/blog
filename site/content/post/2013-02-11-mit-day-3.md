Day 3 started with my winning the Twitter competition with this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p>
    Where can you get 8 strangers from 5 different countries choose a new business idea and come up with a plan in a few hours? Only at <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23MITEDP">#MITEDP</a>
  </p>

Then we had classes by [Matt Marx](http://executive.mit.edu/faculty/profile/197-matt-marx),[William Aulet](http://executive.mit.edu/faculty/profile/58-william-aulet), [Elaine Chen](http://executive.mit.edu/faculty/profile/287-elaine-chen), and [John McEleney](http://executive.mit.edu/faculty/profile/201-john-mceleney).

Even during lunch (at room E52, 6th floor of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship &#8211; Tang Building) we are lectured. In this case by [Scott Stern](http://executive.mit.edu/faculty/profile/194-scott-stern). Non stop from 7am until 8pm (or later, depending on how hard working your team is).
