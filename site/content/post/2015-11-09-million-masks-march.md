On Thursday, coming back home from a meeting, I run into the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=million+masks+march+london&oq=million+masks+march+london&gws_rd=cr&ei=tttAVtWiPMr9Uqntm5AM#q=million+masks+march+london&tbm=nws" target="_blank">Million Masks March</a>. While I assume I agree with most of their anti-system protests (the truth is I did not bother to read them), I think their choice of Guy Fawkes as an "icon", even if a graphical one as proposed by the comic/movie "V for Vendetta", is a very stupid one. Just read about what that historical figure had in mind and judge for yourself.

Another thing that struck me is the media sensationalism, the government paranoia and over-reaction, and the typical "apparatus show of force", including a large number of policemen, police vehicles, and even laser projections on public buildings, like the message projected on the National Gallery regarding the obligation to comply with police request to remove face maskings, and saying:

> "Failure to comply (sic; notice it did not say "failure to do so") is an offence"
