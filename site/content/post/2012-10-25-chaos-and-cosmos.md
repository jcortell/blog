On Tuesday I went to listen to Mitchell J. Feigenbaum and Albert J. Libchaber (mathematical physicists) discuss <a title="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/News-Events-Public-Programs/Calendar/Detail?id=12136" href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/News-Events-Public-Programs/Calendar/Detail?id=12136" target="_blank">chaos theory at CUNY Graduate Center</a>.

After that I went to <a title="http://mcnallyjackson.com/" href="http://mcnallyjackson.com/" target="_blank">McNally Jackson Books</a>, a great book store in SoHo, and to the opening reception for “<a title="http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/rosemarie-trockel-a-cosmos" href="http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/rosemarie-trockel-a-cosmos" target="_blank">Rosemarie Trockel: A Cosmos</a>", at the New Museum, organized by Massimiliano Gioni, Associate Director and Director of Exhibitions, and Jenny Moore, Associate Curator, in collaboration with Rosemarie Trockel and Lynne Cooke, chief curator of the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid (Spain).

Interestingly enough, cosmos is antithetical to the concept of chaos, and in Mandarin Chinese _cosmos_ is _yuzhou_, which literally translated means _space-time_.

> **But we know space and time are relative, we know how the gravitational pull distorts space and time, how a lover nearby, or missing, distorts both space and time. Order (cosmos), chaos... united? distorted?**
