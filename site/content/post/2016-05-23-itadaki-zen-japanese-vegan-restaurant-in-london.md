One of my corporate advisors is Vegetarian, and we wanted to have a meeting over dinner. He tasked me with finding a restaurant in central London, so I chose [Itadaki Zen](http://www.itadakizen-uk.com/), a vegan Japanese restaurant.

I vividly remember [Kajitsu](http://www.kajitsunyc.com/), a Shojin cuisine restaurant in New York, as one of the most surprising, delicious, and different restaurants I have ever dined in. So I thought this could be similar. But unfortunately it is not.

The food and the prices are OK (for London), but nothing the least bit exciting about it. It is Japanese, and it is vegan. That is all.
