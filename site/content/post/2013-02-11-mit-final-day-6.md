The final day was an interesting one.

My team (team _senZa_) choose me to do the presentation of the team`s project. We all thought we did an excellent job, and everybody in the room (372) congratulated us. One of the judges even said "it is the best one I have ever seen". But...Â lo and behold, we were not selected to the final round. And what`s even worst, we received almost no feedback.

Yet, the worst was having to endure Frederic Kerrest alpha-male typeÂ arrogance during his lunch presentation. _What do they feed them for breakfast? I`ll have the other thing, please_. ðŸ˜‰

Certificate award in hand, the MIT adventure is over. Overall, a great experience and awesome networking opportunities. Now I should stop blogging about it and start writing to all those people whose business cards are sitting on my desk and whose LinkedIn profile connexions are awaiting for replies.
