Tuesday July 7th I was also invited, this time by Prof Tony Young (National Clinical Director for Innovation NHS England), to speak at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Med-Tech-Campus/events/223254023/" target="_blank">MedTech event</a> held at <a href="http://www.uclpartners.com/" target="_blank">University College London Partners</a>.

The other three speakers also talked about different aspects of MedTech:

  * Jim Dawton, Director Great Fridays “Disrupting Healthcare through Design”
  * Henrietta Hughes, Regional Medical Director, NHS England ‘Innovation From the Frontline of Primary Care`
  * Prof. Jo Martin, National Clinical Director for Pathology, ‘eCPD and More’

It was also another great event for networking, with over 100 people there, all related to MedTech.
