Wednesday was a long day.

First I was invited to a VIP breakfast executive briefing and presentation by IBM at 7:45am. The event, in which IBM showcased their Watson technology and three partner companies talked about how they are leveraging NLP capabilities, lasted until 12:30pm, but I stayed for an extra hour for a meeting with an IBM executive.

Then I headed back to the office for 3 conference calls. By 7:00pm I was ready to go to the Social Radar startup launch party Stephanie and I had been invited to. Since it was at Milk Studios in Chelsea, a few blocks from our apartment, we decided to walk although it was raining.

I am sure it was a great party, with all the expected "features" like a DJ, food fromÂ <a style="color: #9f7e7f;" href="http://milkbarstore.com/" target="_blank">Momofuku Milk Bar</a>,Â <a style="color: #9f7e7f;" href="http://lukeslobster.com/" target="_blank">Lukeâ€™s Lobster</a>Â andÂ <a style="color: #9f7e7f;" href="http://www.oddfellowsnyc.com/" target="_blank">OddFellows</a>, live painting byÂ <a style="color: #9f7e7f;" href="http://www.nokingscollective.com/" target="_blank">No Kings Collective</a>, print-making, a photo booth... but upon arrival, there were two lines, the "regular" line and the "VIP" line. I understand not everybody can get in at the same time, particularly since 1500 people RSVP (which means less than 500 would show up, but still, a lot of people), but _really_?, so many VIPs that a second line wasÂ needed?

It might be NY`s concept of _cool_ and _fabulous_ andÂ _glamorous_, but I was not up to waiting in line. So we headed to another party we were invited to: <a title="http://www.newmuseum.org/calendar/view/annual-white-party" href="http://www.newmuseum.org/calendar/view/annual-white-party" target="_blank">The New Museum`s Annual White Party for Members</a>.

Now, that`s what I call a cool summer fÃªte. The _vibe_ and people attending the party were even cooler thanÂ previous editions. More people wearing white, as the theme of the party suggested (_attire: white & bling_), and more people with artsy outfits, yet no stuffiness and high brows. It was all fun, music, great cocktails, private viewing of the exhibits (<a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #00a88e;" href="http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/roberto-cuoghi">Roberto Cuoghi</a>,Â <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #00a88e;" href="http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/camille-henrot">Camille Henrot</a>, &Â <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #00a88e;" href="http://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/ragnar-kjartansson">Ragnar Kjartansson</a>), DJ sets byÂ <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #00a88e;" href="http://heavenlybeat.tumblr.com/">Heavenly Beat</a>Â &Â <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #00a88e;" href="http://teen-nyc.tumblr.com/">TEEN</a>, and even a limited edition print byÂ <a style="font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #00a88e;" href="http://www.newmuseum.org/pages/view/limited-edition">Quentin Jones</a>. But of course, as always, the best was sharing theÂ awesome views from the Sky Room with my beloved wife.

I could have stayed there all night. Too bad we had to eventually go back home, but a conference call with Singapore, an interview with an analyst in India, and a sales webinar with Colombia meant having to get up really early next morning and having to face another long day. I guess it can`t all be party and fun... yet ðŸ˜‰
