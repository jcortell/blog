On Tuesday June 21 I was invited to attend the Health Tech Innovators event that took place in London City Hall, organized by Digital Health London, MedCity, and Tech London Advocates.

It consisted of three panels (NHS, Innovators, and Corporate) and an open-bar networking.

Besides some interesting presentations, the main point as always was to network with old colleagues (like Sara – CEO of MedCity, Kay – Health Chair Tech London Advocates, Nooman – Silicon Valley Bank, or Hak – Advisor) and new ones (Brian – Partner PWC Health Advisory, Dough – Medical Director Aviva, John – Healthcare Konica Minolta, Marco – Health Solutions Janssen, Ifan – Healthcare Welsh Government, Martin – NIHR, Axel – ICL, and many more).
