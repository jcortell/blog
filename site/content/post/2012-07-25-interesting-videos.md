Let me share some odd videos I have watched recently, thanks to Leaitrice and Patricia:

The famous <a title="http://youtu.be/sTJ7AzBIJoI" href="http://youtu.be/sTJ7AzBIJoI" target="_blank">&#8220;Sunscreen&#8221; music video</a> (the text comes from an <a title="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column,0,4054576.column" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-schmich-sunscreen-column,0,4054576.column" target="_blank">essay</a> written in 1997 by Mary Schmich, a columnist at the Chicago Tribune, as a graduation speech for the class of &#8217;97) which gives some amazing advice for life. There is even a <a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcmmjY4gc_k" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcmmjY4gc_k" target="_blank">StarWars Version</a>.

<a title="http://www.funnyordie.com/drunkhistory" href="http://www.funnyordie.com/drunkhistory" target="_blank">Drunk History</a>: get some history students drunk, have them narrate historical events, while reenacting them&#8230; more fun than it seems. Watch them all.

Unbelievably messed up Bible stories. Here is <a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcWR9sjBy3A" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcWR9sjBy3A" target="_blank">chapter 1</a>, and you watch the rest if you like (links on the side).

And, of course, everybody knows TED lectures by now, but here is a particularly interesting one: <a title="http://www.ted.com/talks/neil_harbisson_i_listen_to_color.html" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/neil_harbisson_i_listen_to_color.html" target="_blank">the artist that can hear color</a>.
