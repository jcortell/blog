On Thursday we (Carlos and Victoria from Kanteron, my wife and I) were invited, since we are members, to the TechHub 5th birthday party at an abandoned textile warehouse in London.

The party was expertly organized by the TechHub crew, and had everything you need to ensure a great party: two DJs, karaoke, photo-booth, grilled cheese sandwiches, ice-cream, cupcakes, booze, and cool tech (this time it was the <a href="https://sprout.hp.com/uk/en/" target="_blank">HP Sprout</a>).

While the venue was quite large, it quickly filled out with TechHub members and alumni (mostly entrepreneurs and coders), VCs, and other people from the Silicon Roundabout scene.

Thank you for the invitation, TechHub, it was a blast!

This is what the _twittersphere_ has to say about the party:
