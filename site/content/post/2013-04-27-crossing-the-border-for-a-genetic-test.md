A few weeks ago, as part of an unusual birthday gift, my fiancé and I signed up to get our genetic test.

So we ordered the test kit online, and when we entered the state (NY), a big warning told us that according to state laws, we could not produce or mail the samples back to their labs from New York. WTF?! OK, whatever. As if a nonsensical law did not have many ways around it. Bring it on!

So a few days later the kits came, with very detailed instructions and easy to follow procedure (if you consider producing gallons of spit &#8220;easy&#8221;).

But being cautious as I am, I decided to research online, from reputable sources, the whole legal status of genetic sample and shipment in New York. Both, a <a title="http://www.legalgenealogist.com/blog/2012/12/23/ny-and-md-limits-on-23andme/" href="http://www.legalgenealogist.com/blog/2012/12/23/ny-and-md-limits-on-23andme/" target="_blank">genealogist</a> with a law degree, and a couple of <a title="http://silberzahnjones.com/2011/04/20/moores-law-steam-engines-and-genetic-technology/" href="http://silberzahnjones.com/2011/04/20/moores-law-steam-engines-and-genetic-technology/" target="_blank">scholars</a>, wrote posts about it with enough detail and information to make me reconsider my &#8220;who-cares&#8221; attitude.

What was my only way out? To cross the border to produce and send the samples back. And that&#8217;s what I did. I took the train in Grand Central Station, rode to New Jersey, delivered to FedEx, and rode back. One hour later I had accomplished my mission of both getting what I wanted and abiding with the law. Annoying and stupid. But it&#8217;s the law. 

In 5 weeks we&#8217;ll have the results. I&#8217;m sure it will be worth it, no only for the information coming back, but also for the very altruistic reason of contributing to research and a deeper understanding of our genes.
