March 1-4 I traveled to Las Vegas to exhibit at the largest healthcare IT trade show in the world: <a href="http://www.himssconference.org/" target="_blank">HIMSS</a>.

Hitachi, one of our partners, asked my company to be part of their booth for the second year in a row, and I was very glad to share the booth with them and another open source company they recently acquired: Pentaho.

Throughout the duration of the show I had numerous business breakfasts (including a very early one with IBM and their new CEO of Watson Health, who until recently was CEO of Philips Healthcare), lunches and dinners, and was invited to several events, like Microsoftâ€™s party at the <a href="https://www.luxor.com/en/entertainment/bodies-the-exhibition.html" target="_blank">Bodies exhibition in the Luxor Hotel</a>, and Lexmarkâ€™s party.

The event was very very successful for my company, with lots of interest from potential customers, analysts, and other technology companies. One of the key reasons for this success was that we recently hired our new President & CCO, John Memarian, who was President of Merge (company acquired by IBM for $1B). The other key is the fact that my lovely wife helped us man the booth ðŸ˜‰
