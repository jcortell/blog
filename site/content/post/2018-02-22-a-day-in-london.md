On Wednesday I had breakfast in Fort Erie, lunch in Toronto, dinner on a plane, breakfast in Reykjiavik, lunch in London, and dinner in Brussels.

It has been a while since I was last in London. And I do not miss it. At all.

The truth is I had a crazy schedule, and I managed to pull it off: as soon as I arrived in Brussels, I checked in the hotel, left my luggage, and took the Eurostar high-speed train to London.

In London I went to the office, checked snail-mail (I can't believe how much of that we still get), meet an advisor, had a tea with him at the station, went to pick up my wife's laptop that was being repaired, took the Eurostar again, and went back to Brussels for dinner and to finally sleep on a bed.

I don't know if it's the fact that I was in such a rush, or the fact that it was rush hour, or the fact that I went to the most crowded places (like Shoreditch and Oxford Circus) but the truth is it was all crammed, packed, noisy, pushy, fast, and annoying. Perhaps not as much as Times Square in NY, were tourist/zombies combine with corporate drones to create a tsunami-like mob that is swallowed by the subway and its characteristic stench and rats. But it was unpleasant nonetheless.

I don't need the absolute peace and quiet of most of Canada. I can settle with the slow pace and civilized ways of, let's say, Ibiza (this time of the year, not in the Summer, of course) ;-)
