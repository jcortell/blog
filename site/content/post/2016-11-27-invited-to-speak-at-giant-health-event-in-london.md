Right after I returned from Germany, and before departing for Paraguay, I was invited to speak at the <a href="https://gianthealthevent.com" target="_blank">GIANT Health event</a> (the “global innovation and new technology health event), health in The Coronet, London.



The event run for 3 days, November 16-18, with 3 parallel tracks, and it included over 200 speakers. I spoke November 18, in the main auditorium.



There was an exhibition area, with several companies and organizations showing their innovations and technologies.

The venue was quite “grunge”, and it made you feel more like you were performing in a rock concert, rather than speaking at a healthcare event. All in all a massive, interesting, and fun event (except for the poor _kamikaze_ organizers 😉 ).
