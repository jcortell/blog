In England, Summer apparently lasts about 3 days. And it arrives (and leaves) in May.

Those three days were very nice: we went for walks in the parks and village, we enjoyed the flowers blooming and seeing families have fun and catch their vitamin-D-processing-sun-ray-yearly-dose, and we had a lovely breakfast in our castleâ€™s balcony seeing a group of elders play cricket in the Wimbledon Practice Courts.

It was nice, albeit brief, Summer.
