On Friday morning I had a meeting, so I took the 1 Subway line to 168th St.Â 

[mudslide:picasa,0,111219615350942087056,5718647890686730977]

Given, the station was not the coolest in NY, but what shocked me was that at the other end of the platform, there was a man on the floor, and people just passed by as if nobody was there.

So I crossed to the other side, and asked him if he needed help. No response. I went to look for help, and finally found an MTA employee. I described the situation, and his response was &#8220;_Oh, don&#8217;t worry, he sort of lives there_&#8220;. That&#8217;s it. [Sic(k)].
