After the cruise my wife and I took our American relatives to Barcelona for 3 days. Nothing new for me there except the Sagrada Familia (yes, it`s true: after countless trips to Barcelona, I had never visited the amazing architectural wonder), although there are some things I can never get tired of, like Gaudi`s architecture, or Picasso`s museum.

Staying at the convenient and elegant <a title="http://www.hotelespanya.com/en/home-3/" href="http://www.hotelespanya.com/en/home-3/" target="_blank">Hotel España</a>, next to the Liceu, was a great idea, made even better by their Martín Berasategui`s restaurant _Fonda_. Great food, great art, wonderful Barcelona as always.
