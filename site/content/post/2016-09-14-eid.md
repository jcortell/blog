Monday, September 12, was the <a href="http://eid.mindthebridge.com/" target="_blank">European Innovation Day (EID)</a> at the <a href="http://www.computerhistory.org/" target="_blank">Computer History Museum</a> in Mountain View, CA.

Although the museum is not open on Mondays, we had access to a few of the exhibits, like the one about the IBM 1401, the awesome PDP-1 (_Creating the Hacker Culture_), and autonomous vehicles (and yes, of course, I go into a Google driverless car, and took a selfie).

But the reason why we went there was not (only) to see the museum but to participate in the EID event.

In the morning the selected EU _scaleups_ pitched their companies to a big group of Silicon Valley investors (from Google, Twitter, Samsung, Microsoft, Delta, Sky, etc) in a closed-door invitation-only event. <span class="s1"></span>They asked me to present Kanteron Systems the last because we have such a powerful story. And as a matter of fact, right after the _pitch,_ I had investors from all over (USA, China, India...) talking to me and scheduling follow-up one-on-one meetings.

After a lunch break, we went into the auditorium for a packed session of talks. The roaster of speakers was top notch:

  * The keynote was by legendary investor Tim Draper
  * Paul Timmers, Director DG Connect, European Commission, talked about _EU Policies_
  * Betsy Masiello, Senior Director, Uber; and Melissa Blaustein, Allied for Startups, discussed _Tech & Entrepreneurship vs. Policy in the EU_
  * Rashmi Gopinath, Microsoft Ventures; Deepak Jeevankumar, General Catalyst Partners; and Michel Wendell, Nexit Ventures, discussed _SV investors_
  * Alberto Onetti, Mind the Bridge, introduced the very interesting research paper "_EU vs._ US_: A deep analysis of exits from Mind the Bridge/Crunchbase_"
  * Lutz Finger, Quantum Physicist & Director Data Science & Data Engineering, LinkedIn; and Giovanni Iachello, Head of International and Data Products, LinkedIn, talked about _The skills and economic graph_
  * The _Women 2.0_ panel was formed by: Elizabeth Gore, Dell; Jessica Butcher, Blippar; and Camille Sailer, European American Chamber of Commerce; moderated by Nora Poggi, She Started It
  * "_How EU corporates are cracking Open Innovation_" was discussed by Ernesto Ciorra, CIO, Enel; Prith Banerjee, CTO, Schneider; Giovanni Loser, Former GM, Illy Caffé; Eduardo Dominguez Puerta, COO, Airbus-SV; and Moderated by Henry Chesbrough, UC Berkeley Haas School of Business, “the Father of Open Innovation”
  * Krysten Jenci, Director, Office of Digital Services Industries, U.S. Department of Commerce; Audrey Plonk, Director, Government and Policy, Intel Corporation; moderated by John Miller, Vice President for Global Cybersecurity Policy and Law @ ITIC, discussed _Perspectives on Privacy, Security & Data Flows_
  * Willem Jonker, CEO, EIT Digital, talked about _turning EU research into business_
  * The "colorful note" was the panel titled "_Startup heavens in Europe_", formed by Mikk Vainik, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Estonia; Francisco de la Torre Prados, Mayor of Malaga, Spain; Penny Harwood, London & Partners; moderated by Burton Lee, Stanford University
  * Pēteris Zilgalvis, Head of Unit DG Connect, European Commission closed the sessions

Nonetheless, the best part of all was to talk and network with all speakers and some other VIP guests afterward.

It was, definitely, quite an intense day.
