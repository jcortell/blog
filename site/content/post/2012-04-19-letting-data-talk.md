Government debt does not explain it all:</p> 

Unemployment is, indeed, quite inapelable:</p> 

And minimum wage:</p> 

So, perhaps, taking all those (and the last "devastating evidence" one) graphs into account, French and German governments have tricked, via manipulative markets and rating agencies, ignorant technocrat Spain`s PP government into cutting social spending (like education and health, which in turn becomes productivity, and minimum wage and job stability, which promotes spending and growth) so we go deeper into the hole, and they take advantage of our excellent engineers at a low rate, while speculating with debt and making sure Spain does not become a strong competitor...</p> 

Don`t they realise that with a monarchy that "shoots itself in the foot trying to hunt elephants and hiding corruption and scandalous ties", a media that is so self complacent and ass kissing that feels more like brothels, politicians so entrenched in the corrupt game that with two degrees of separation you could not find an honest Spaniard anymore, a starch church mingling in public affairs, and a population so absorbed by soccer, celebrities and fear, they do not need to do that? Spaniards doom themselves! We always have, damn religious guilt, envy, fear, pride and inferiority complex!
