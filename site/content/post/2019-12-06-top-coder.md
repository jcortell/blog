According to [CodersRank](https://profile.codersrank.io/user/jcortell) I'm in the top 10% of coders worldwide (they have ranked over 29,000 computer programmers, or coders"), with a "Senior Rank" and a score of 516... even though I only code in my spare time!

<!--more-->

It must be a bug.

In any case, for what is worth, they think I'm in the:

* Top 1% worldwide for HTML
* Top 4% worldwide for CSS
* Top 13% worldwide for JavaScript
