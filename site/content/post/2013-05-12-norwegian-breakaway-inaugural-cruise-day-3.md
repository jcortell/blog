All things must come to an end, so today we sadly had to disembark. After a nice breakfast and a last stroll through the ship, we disembarked very fast and easily, and in a few minutes we were back home in Chelsea (after going through the most absurd and disorganized taxi system I have seen in this country).

What`s my verdict? It is an exceptionally nice ship for a mass market, even considering its gigantic size.

In exactly a month, the next cruise: Alaska with Regent cruise line (now, that`s going to be awesome!).
