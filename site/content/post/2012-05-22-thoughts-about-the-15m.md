May 15th I went to the #15M demosntration in Malaga (Spain). As I was by myself, and to document and support &#8220;the cause&#8221;, I took my camerca and zig-zagged thourgh the crowd, in a kind of amateur sociological analysis of the most interesting social movement in these turbulent times. Here are some not-so-random thoughts:

  * While no particular spacial organization can be detected in the demonstration, the group dynamics and power hierarchy (even if perceived representation power) applied their invisible forces once more to take the radicals (or most outspoken at least) to march in the front line, families in the middle, and party goers and curious at the back
  * Most &#8220;organizers&#8221; and &#8220;speakers&#8221; and &#8220;banner-holders and support van drivers&#8221; were foreign (mainly Argentinians)
  * Although supposedly devoid of political affiliation, the only ones showing political signs were those without direct political representation in the form of &#8220;their own party&#8221; (anarchist, republicans, etc)
  * While there was no &#8220;organized plan of action&#8221; (I wonder if the &#8220;assemblies&#8221; could get to one without some sort of non-hierarchical order and/or structure), the #cazerolada and #lacaixaesmordor seem to channel the discontempt towards the direct real cause (superficial, first and most apparent, but not necessarily the most important) of the dire social tensions of today: banks and the financial system&#8230; although how about the political system that allowed that to happen (from corruption to &#8220;democratic&#8221; representation)? how about the psychological causes (from fear to greed and ambition)? how about the underlying cause (from inequality to blind consumption-based capitalism)?
