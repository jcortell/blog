Just like it happened with the operating system, when I migrated from OSX back to GNU-Linux Debian, I have decided to go back to Emacs for most things. from blog posts to programming.

<!--more-->

There are many alternatives to get the job done, from Atom to Sublime, to InteliJ to Vim. But I was looking for a combination of FLOSS, extremely hackable, and  good performance (although startup times are not the best). So that leads you directly to Emacs.

It's been so many years since I last used it, that I had forgotten most of its keyboard bindings and quirks. But being able to modifying it to fit exactly your preferences and the way you work is priceless.

Not for the Drag-and-Drop crew (although it does have a GUI), but most definitely worth trying out if you like control and absolute personalization: [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
