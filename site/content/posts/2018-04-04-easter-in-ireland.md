We spent the first four days of April in Ireland, the only country in Western Europe I had not visited yet, enjoying an activity-packed Easter break with my girls.

Taking advantage of the Easter school break, I took my girls to the county of Kildare, in Ireland. We stayed at the amazing [KClub](https://www.kclub.ie/). Although the hotel has two spectacular golf courses, constantly rating in the top of Irish golf courses, having even hosted the 36th Ryder Cup, we enjoyed many other activities, like:

- Kayaking with wet suits in the River Liffey, under a hail storm
- Horseback riding in the nearby Abbeyfield Farm (2015 Equestrian Centre of the year)
- Falconry demonstrations
- Archery
- Swimming in the indoor pool
- Enjoying the outdoor hot-tub
- Bicycle rides through the forest and mud

The trip ended with an idyllic picnic thanks to the beautiful picnic basket that the hotel prepared for us. I must say the service was incredibly nice, kind and efficient.

A trip to remember.
