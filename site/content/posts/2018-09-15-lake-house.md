September 15th, as some of you already know, we moved for a few months to a house on Lake Erie (Canada).

<!--more-->

Both for business and family reasons, my wife, my son and I are going to spend some time on this side of the Atlantic.

The house could not be more idyllic, and the location more bucolic. With the beach right outside our porch, we see all kinds of critters moving around the house all the time: geese, chipmunks, squirrels, all kinds of birds, butterflies... and no matter where you look you see green, except if you look South, then you see the lake. Beautiful.

As my son says, "I can't wait to see it snowed and frozen". I can.
