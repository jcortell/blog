Wednesday October 3rd I was in New York for a couple of very interesting business meetings.

It takes me less than half an hour to drive to Buffalo's airport from home. And in just 47 minutes of flight time, I landed in New York city.

I was in town for two very interesting meetings.

The second one, even more thrilling, was with a boutique investment bank to talk about some really exciting things. Unfortunately I can't share anythhing about that meeting yet, but I will (hopefully soon).

In a quick day trip New York reminded me of all the reasons why I love it and hate it.

But perhaps the most disgustingly interesting part of my trip was this:
