I hate charitable dinners where most (or almost all) of the money goes to caviar, tuxedos, valet parking and other hoopla.

Fortunately there are other charitable dinners, where you won`t see any <a title="https://www.escolar.net/MT/archives/2011/11/la-nueva-politica-de-igualdad.html" href="https://www.escolar.net/MT/archives/2011/11/la-nueva-politica-de-igualdad.html" target="_blank">PP mothers</a>, like yesterday`s organized by <a title="https://foro.enfemenino.com/forum/f257/__f142_f257-Taller-de-cocina-vegetariana-en-valencia-d.html" href="https://foro.enfemenino.com/forum/f257/__f142_f257-Taller-de-cocina-vegetariana-en-valencia-d.html" target="_blank">Didi</a>, where people sit on the floor, eat off plastic plates, and enjoy Didi`s deliciously vegan cooking and sincere love, so just about all money collected goes to Calcutta`s orphans.

Namaskar, Didi.
