This week, from Sunday to Thursday, I have been in Chicago for a business trip, presenting at RSNA with Google.

<!--more-->

On Sunday I flew from Buffalo to Chicago. Upon arrival I took an Uber and went straight to the largest event space in North America: McCormick Place, where the largest medical imaging trade show in the world (RSNA) was taking place.

My company, Kanteron Systems, was exhibiting with Google, so my team (our President & CCO, and our Asia-Pacific Director) and I spent 5 intense days in meetings, demos, business breakfast and dinners. I was also invited to present at one of the conferences.

Another one of those airport-business-hotel-business-airport trips. Successful and exciting, from a business point of view, but not exactly personally enriching.

At least the [hotel](https://ambassadorchicago.com/), the same one I try to go to every year, is still nice, even after changing name and ownership.
