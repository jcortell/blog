On Friday I was invited to take a highly confidential tour of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Factory in Brackley, UK.

Danny Hornigold, Formula One and Sporting Event Host, was the liveliest and funniest host ever. But it was Dom Riefstahl, Race Support Team Leader and Test Engineer at at Mercedes-AMG Petronas, the one who provided the detailed information (presentation titled: 'Better Decision - How teams use big data to give vital insights to drivers and clients') during the tour and lunch.

Quite an amazing facility, incredibly knowledgeable and sophisticated experts... I wish I could give details and show more photos, but as it was highly confidential, all I can share is [this](https://photos.app.goo.gl/sZR2GATwC9hhWTvq7).
