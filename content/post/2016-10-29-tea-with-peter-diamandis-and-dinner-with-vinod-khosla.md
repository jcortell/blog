Monday, OctoberÂ 10th, I had the pleasure to have a chat with Peter Diamandis at a coffee (tea for me, thank you) break.

He was very interested in talking about my company (Kanteron Systems), as we have developed technology that can really help some of his investments in Precision Medicine and Longevity.

Even more interesting than talking about investments, it was to know a little bit the man behind the legend.

Something similar happened when I had dinner on the beach, that same day, with legendary investor Vinod Khosla.
