For my wife`s birthday I acquired a piece of art from <a title="https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/pawel-althamer" href="https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/pawel-althamer" target="_blank">Paweł Althamer`s "The Neighbors"</a>, which run through April 13 at the New Museum in New York city.

> Since the early 1990s, Althamer (b. 1967 Warsaw, Poland) has established a unique artistic practice featuring an expanded approach to sculptural representation and consistently experimental models of social collaboration.

It was great to discuss with a museum curator which piece to select (we agreed without a doubt), and it`s a pleasure to have this piece in the living room of our Chelsea apartment.

To celebrate it we had dinner nearby, at Daniel Boulud`s excellent (although mainly carnivore) <a title="https://www.dbgb.com/nyc/" href="https://www.dbgb.com/nyc/" target="_blank">DBGB</a> "gastro pub".
