In October my wife and I spent a week in Tokyo.

<!--more-->

I've fallen way behind on my blog writing, so I might forget some details, and pack too much info in a single post, but I need to catch up, so here it goes.

October 11th Stephanie and I flew to Tokyo. The first objective was to attend the trade shows [BioJapan](https://jcd-expo.jp/en/outline.html) and [Medical Japan](https://www.medical-jpn.jp/tokyo/en-gb.html). BioJapan was definitely worth it, while Medical Japan wasn't. In any case, all that was business, and I assume you are not interested in that, so ask me if you want to know more. Here are [some pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/hDpncVoH1Vu4e3A2A). I also had some meetings with Tokyu and Mitsubishi Real Estate. [Pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/TbrJDec7tFjRiY1L9).

But of course, it wasn't all business (and getting sick, which I did and had to stay in bed for three full days!). We stayed in an excellently located [hotel](https://www.centurion-hotel.com/cl-akasaka/) in Akasaka surrounded by restaurants and confectionary stores, with a surprisingly large room. From there, and with its proximity to the subway station, it was a breeze to visit attractions and restaurants such as:
* Denko Sekka - Michelin Bib Gourmand guide Hiroshima style okonomiyaki 
* Yagenbori - Amazing tamagoyaki yasaka!
* Akasaka Umaya - Adorable restaurant by Kabuki actor Ichikawa Ennosuke the third 
* 天彩 - Amairo, great tendon (tempura+donburi)
* UOHaRU - Market seafood dinner
* Cat cafe
* Takeshita Dori
* Shibuya crossing
* Sensō-ji temple
* Akihabara
* Character stores at Tokyo Station
* and a lot more

We love it. My wife finally understands my fascination (although, unfortunately, not enough to consider moving there). We will definitely be back. But the trip was not over. That was only the beginning! Now time to cruise all around Japan.
