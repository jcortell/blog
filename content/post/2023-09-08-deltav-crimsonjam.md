On Friday I was invited to attend Delta v Demo Day at MIT’s Kresge Auditorium , and then spent the rest of the evening at the Crimson Jam.

[MIT's Delta v Demo Day](https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/accelerator/demo-day/) is a fun day for entrepreneurship. In their own words:

> Demo Day showcases our passionate and talented student founders, featuring pitches of their innovative, world-changing companies solving the toughest problems across many industries. Following the presentations, attendees have the chance to visit each team’s Expo Booth to learn even more about our startups’ products and services.
> Demo Day is the culmination of three months of intensive work and focus by our student teams. It’s the first chance to present their world-changing products and services to an audience of MIT students, mentors, friends, investors, and potential customers.

It was a great opportunity to catch up with old and new friends, like MIT Prof. Bill Aulet, who was my Entrepreneurship teacher many years ago, and several co-founders, some of them from Harvard iLabs teams, like AugMend Health, JaneEnergy, or Eki Agrivoltaics.

Definitely a high-energy flashy event, with school mascot, cheerleaders, percussion band, cheesy videos... Quite the different tone from Harvard!

Then, walking back home, I stopped at Harvard Yard for [Crimson Jam](https://dso.college.harvard.edu/crimson-jam), the Harvard College Welcome Back event. A fun evening with live music, lawn games, photo booth, and food.
