On Wednesday I flew to London to participate in the UBS Industry Leaders Network (ILN) meeting.

The Boston Logan airport was almost absolutely deserted at 11pm on a Wednesday, which made it for an easy and almost pleasurable check-in and security experience. The flight wasn't even half full either, which, again, meant more comfort in every way. When I arrived, I went to a Persian restaurant for dinner ([Iran Restaurant](https://www.iranrestaurant.co.uk/)) and straight to bed.

I was invited to stay at the elegant and incredibly well located [Four Seasons Park Lane hotel](https://www.fourseasons.com/london/), with a Toto toilet, thank you very much. 

The ILN event took place in the hotel. I meet old friends, and new ones, like David Yeung (Founder & CEO at Green Monday), Michelle Howard (Strategic Policy Advisor at The D Group), Manny Shar (Managing Director at Orbit Fab), Rodrigo Garcia Gonzalez (Co-CEO at NotPla), Anthony Chow (Co-Founder Agronomics), Jean Nehme (Founder & CEO, Touch Surgery and Vice President Strategic Partnerships, Medtronic), Sarah Nobel (Supply chain strategy at Deloitte), Nicola Rolsa (Metaverse Strategy at Accenture), and Dr Jane Pollock (Lecturer and Researcher, University of Oxford).

We also had the pleasure to talk with Mark Goddard (Head, UK HNW, UBS), Konstantin Sidorov (Founder & CEO at London Technology Club), and my favorite economist: Paul Donavan (Global Chief Economist, UBS).

An excellent networking dinner made a wonderful day absolutely perfect. Thank you UBS!
