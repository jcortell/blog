We spent this Christmas in Spain (Valencia and Malaga) with family and friends.

When you drive next to the Mediterranean sea to go to the office, and see a breathtaking sunrise while you refill your car`s gas tank, work does not seem such a drag. 

As usual, the highlight was food. In particular, in Valencia the always superb <a title="https://www.samsha.es" href="https://www.samsha.es" target="_blank">Samsha Restaurant</a> (probably my favorite in the world, with chef Victor Rodrigo, winner of the Chef of the Year Award in Spain), the surprisingly good tapas of <a title="https://www.picoteodevicio.com" href="https://www.picoteodevicio.com" target="_blank">Picoteo de Vicio</a> (thanks for the recommendation, Eugenia), and the dramatically palatial setting of <a title="https://www.laembajada.es" href="https://www.laembajada.es" target="_blank">La Embajada</a>. Not forgetting <a title="https://www.lotelitovalencia.com" href="https://www.lotelitovalencia.com" target="_blank">Lotelito</a>, where we celebrated the typical office Christmas lunch, and <a title="https://www.yelp.com/biz/mood-food-valencia" href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/mood-food-valencia" target="_blank">MoodFood</a>, small but excellent. But even the simple tapas and bocadillo in <a title="https://valencia.salir.com/casa_mundo" href="https://valencia.salir.com/casa_mundo" target="_blank">Casa Mundo</a> were good. And, of course, the best, eating with the family at home.

We also had delicious food in the always beautiful Malaga. We took the high speed train (Americans only wish they had such an awesome train), and were there in 4 hours. Enjoyed super traditional food at <a title="https://elpimpi.com" href="https://elpimpi.com" target="_blank">El Pimpi</a>, and went to Marbella (for business). Of course, one night is not enough, but it`s all we had and we made the best of it.
