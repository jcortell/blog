For the long weekend I went with my girls Horseback riding and fall foliage leaf peeping in Connecticut.

<!--more-->

The beauty of the fall leaves in the splendorous pallet of autumn colors was breathtaking. But bonding with your horse, and seeing your daughter ride her horse like they're best friends having fun, it's priceless.

The hotel (Marriott Mystic in Groton) and meals (Octagon Restaurant, NV Bakery & Market, etc) were nice too. 

A wonderful weekend in nature with family.
