Last week I was interviewed (as art curator) by the Meural team.

Each installment of their Deep Cuts series features a writer, artist, or curator discussing an underrated artist, artwork, movement, or museum.

In Episode 7: “Seriously playful” we discussed the work of one of my favorite artists: [Claudio Zirotti](https://zirotticrea.blogspot.com/).

Check it out!
