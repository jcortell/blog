Astonished I witness the trees rise  
tall from their base,  
not even rooted.

Leafs leave,  
group,  
organize,  
and shifting shapes,  
take to the sky  
only to dive down.

A red dragon,   
a viking vessel,  
coming straight at me.

The memory of holding your hand,  
and blinking,   
gets me through.

But how far could even a never fading memory take me?  
I shall hold your hand again, or be taken by the leafs.
