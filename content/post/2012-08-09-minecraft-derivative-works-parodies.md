Hugo sends me <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uA34PovdYw" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uA34PovdYw" target="_blank">this</a> amazing song/video made in Minecraft. Of course, that leads to <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf7UBjNfXkU" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf7UBjNfXkU" target="_blank">10</a> more, <a title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffZEi6ttXaE" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffZEi6ttXaE" target="_blank">14</a> more... there are so many!

When you make the tools available to the people, and allow them to create (in this case under the safe harbor of "parody") wonderful things happen. It`s NOT all about the money, profit, control... It`s about imagination, art, creativity, culture. That`s how it happens: copying, re-using, mixing, adjusting, modifying... that`s what creativity is really about (or did you think it was about "inventing" and "making unheard of things out of thin air"?).
