On day 3 of our cruise we stopped in Civitavecchia (Rome).

As a _thank you_ gift to my parents, we had arranged three private minivans with bilingual guides, that picked us up in Civitavecchia and took us to Rome.

Much has been written about Rome, with so many archeological remains, and art, combined with a very lively city life and character.

We did not have much time and the group was large, including kids and a person in a wheelchair, so we started at the Spanish Steps, and went to Villa Borghese, one of Rome`s most famous parks, right above Piazza del Popolo. From Pincio`s large terrace we enjoyed a great panoramic view of the city.

Then we focused on a few highlights like Michelangelo’s “Moses” at the Basilica di San Pietro in Vincoli, Aventine Hill`s Knights of Malta keyhole view of St. Peter`s, a guided tour of the Colosseum, and Saint Peter`s Square.

Unfortunately, in order not to miss the ship, some of the highlights we had to see from the van, like Victor Emmanuel Monument (Il Vittoriano – Altare della Patria a.k.a. _torta nuziale_ "the wedding cake", or "the typewriter"), Castel Sant`Angelo, Fontana di Trevi (closed for repairs) or Piazza Navona.
