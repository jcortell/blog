On Sunday we experienced two of the most special things the nearby Somerville has: [PorchFest](https://somervilleartscouncil.org/porchfest/2023) and [Mass Hole Donuts](https://www.massholedonuts.com/).

<!--more-->

PorchFest is an annual event organized by Somerville Arts Council, in which residents volunteer their houses' porches for bands to play in. Visitors just walk around the streets, listening to all kinds of bands perform live from the porches.

Mass Hole Donuts is a donut shop/brand founded by my friend and colleague Peter Gladstone. They only make donut holes and they are the best in Massachusetts, according to Boston Magazine... and I agree! They make them fresh each morning from scratch with the very best ingredients. Their donuts are extremely delicious, with many creative flavors and combinations. The merchandise is also pretty awesome.
