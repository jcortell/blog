Last Saturday, given that the Anarchist Art Festival seemed a little weak, I decided to spend the day at the MoMA (Museum of Modern Art, New York).

<img class="aligncenter" title="New Visions at MoMA" src="https://www.moma.org/images/dynamic_content/exhibition_page/58162.jpg?1325086913" alt="" width="274" height="420" />

First, a nice tour of "<a title="https://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1247" href="https://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/1247" target="_blank">The Shaping of New Visions: Photography, Film, Photobook</a>" exhibition (Edward Steichen Photography Galleries, third floor) by Dr. Elizabeth Cronin, assistant curator of photography at MoMA and NYPL. This exhibition, covering the period from 1910 to today, offers a critical reassessment of photography`s role in the avant-garde and neo-avant-garde movements—with a special emphasis on the medium`s relation to Dada, Bauhaus, Surrealism, Constructivism, New Objectivity, Conceptual, and Post-Conceptual art—and in the development of contemporary artistic practices.

  Bringing together over 250 works from MoMA’s collection, the exhibition features major projects by Man Ray, László Moholy-Nagy, Aleksandr Rodchenko, Germaine Krull, Gerhard Rühm, Helen Levitt, Daido Moriyama, Robert Heinecken, Ed Ruscha, Martha Rosler, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Philip-Lorca DiCorcia, and Walid Raad, among others.

Then, lunch at <a title="https://www.themodernnyc.com/" href="https://www.themodernnyc.com/" target="_blank">The Modern</a> restaurant (inside the museum). With a well deserved Michelin star (yet reasonable prices) this restaurant combines basics such as salads or even strong-odor pizza (re-named "Alsatian crust pie with munster cheese and porcini", of course), with elaborate dishes (poached egg over sea urchin foam, lobster and yam). Definitely on to my list.

And after lunch, a great silent russian film ("<a title="https://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/film_screenings/14856" href="https://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/film_screenings/14856" target="_blank">A Kiss For Mary Pickford</a>") about celebrities, Hollywood, mass hysteria...
