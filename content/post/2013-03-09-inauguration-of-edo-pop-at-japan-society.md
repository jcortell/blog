Yesterday we were invited by Miwako Tezuka (_domo arigato_!) to the inauguration of <a title="https://www.japansociety.org/event/edo-pop-the-graphic-impact-of-japanese-prints" href="https://www.japansociety.org/event/edo-pop-the-graphic-impact-of-japanese-prints" target="_blank">Edo Pop</a> at Japan Society. It was wonderful!

Besides the classic and beautiful nishiki-e works by the masters Katsushika Hokusai (yes,Â _Under the Wave off Kanagawa_ from the series _Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji_, was there), Utagawa Hiroshige, Toshusai Sharaku, Toyota Hokkei, Utagawa Kunisada, Utagawa Kuniyoshi, and Suzuki Harunobu, there were contemporary works by graffiti artist Aiko, strikingly "Japanese" transparencies by Emily Allchurch, reinterpreted iconic portraits by Paul Binnie, political criticism in the work of Ishii Toru and Kazama Sachiko (amazing the large formatÂ _Alas! Heisoku-kan_ work), colorful to an extreme Tomokazu Matsuyama, clash of cultures portrayed by Masami Teraoka, the installation by Jimmy Robert, and the great photographs of Narahashi Asako and Hatakeyama Naoya.

A must-see exhibit that unfortunately can not be followed by dinner at ISE because they seem to have closed their 49th St. location (they still have 56th St. and 56 Pine St., but it`s not the same), although there are a myriad of options near by. <a title="https://www.sakagura.com" href="https://www.sakagura.com" target="_blank">Shakagura</a> anyone? ðŸ˜‰
