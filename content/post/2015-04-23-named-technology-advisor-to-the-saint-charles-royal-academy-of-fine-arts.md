On March 23rd I was named Technology Advisor to the 250 year old Saint Charles Royal Academy of Fine Arts by its 56th president, Dr. Manuel Muñoz.

The Royal Academy has the second largest and most important classical painting collection in Spain, after Madrid`s Museo del Prado.

Technology and Art are two of my passions, so combining the two sounds like a very exciting proposition.
