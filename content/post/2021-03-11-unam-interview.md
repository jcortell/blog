I participated as "specialist" in [Mexico's Autonomous National University (UNAM)](https://www.unam.mx/) [TV program "Abre tu micro"](https://tv.unam.mx/?s=abre+tu+micro), directed by my friend, philosopher, author, and professor David Pastor [Vico](https://vico.mx/). Also in the program, giving voice to the concerns and doubts of the students, Ana Poulette Huitrón López and Joice Vania Martínez Flores (from the Ciencias y Humanidades Plantel Naucalpan School).

I've known Vico for years, since he was teaching at the University of Seville, and invited me to speak in a couple of conferences there. You should really check out his book "[Filosofía para desconfiados](https://www.todostuslibros.com/libros/filosofia-para-desconfiados_978-607-07-5862-1)".
