According to <a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:

> The **uncanny valley** is a hypothesis in the field of [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics") and [3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics "3D computer graphics") [computer animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_animation "Computer animation"), which holds that when human replicas look and act almost, but not perfectly, like actual human beings, it causes a response of [revulsion](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revulsion "wikt:revulsion") among human observers. The "valley" in question is a dip in a proposed graph of the positivity of human reaction as a function of a robot`s human likeness.

> The term was coined by the robotics professor [Masahiro Mori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori "Masahiro Mori") as _Bukimi no Tani Gensh?_ (???????) in 1970. The hypothesis has been linked to [Ernst Jentsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Jentsch "Ernst Jentsch")‘s concept of "[the uncanny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uncanny "The Uncanny")" identified in a 1906 essay, "On the Psychology of the Uncanny."<span style="font-size: 11px"> </span>Jentsch`s conception was elaborated by [Sigmund Freud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud "Sigmund Freud") in a 1919 essay entitled "The Uncanny" ("[Das Unheimliche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Unheimliche "Das Unheimliche")").

It is my hypothesis that the emotional-relationship difficulties experienced by someone suffering from Asperger`s Syndrome (or by someone having to interact with such individual), may be very well explained by the Uncanny Valley hypothesis.
