Red dyes sky and "sea", as they call it, as the sun sets over the Rio de la Plata.  
The promenade fills up withÂ Montevideans with their mates. They smile, oblivious to, or despite of, life`s drama.

This intense red bursts, invades, dyes and covers like a curtain. I must share it with you.  
It`s ephemeral, I know it will pass, but now it feels as if nothing can escape its spillover, which drags along my attention, my sensibility, my pain, my life.
