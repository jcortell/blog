That's the thing with art, sometimes you spend months without creating anything significant, or being exhibited, and then, all of a sudden... my work is exhibited at Saatchi Gallery London and Copenhagen Contemporary within a week!

<!--more-->

This time it was three pieces of visual art:

* ['pART'](https://photos.app.goo.gl/DgMK96oK7Avjzr7x6), collaborative piece - chalk over blackboard, exhibited in the Common Room
* ['Love/Lost/Last/Love'](https://photos.app.goo.gl/LfkLUgUP6SBQ12Dr6), oil on canvas, shown as part of the exhibition 'København, kærlighed & candyfloss'
* ['I wish to keep wishing'](https://photos.app.goo.gl/3JMT2qB5M8i57Kst8) ink on paper, part of Yoko Ono's ‘Wish Tree Garden’

The first two are ephemeral non-commissioned pieces. But the third one, requested by Yoko Ono back in 1996, is finally seen the light, and once the exhibition in Copenhagen is done, it will be sent to Ono’s 'Imagine Peace Tower' on the island of Viðey in Kollafjörður Bay, Iceland: an art installation that consists of a tall column of light dedicated to Ono’s late husband, John Lennon. As a fan of both Ono and Lennon, I'm particularly proud of this one :-)
