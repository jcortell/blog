May 2nd I attended two events: Venture Cafe's 'Charting the Future of Japanese Innovation' at the Cambridge Innovation Center, and the Harvard Innovation Labs Alumni dinner at the Harvard Business School's Spangler Center.

As I'm passionately interested in Japan and innovation, [Charting the Future of Japanese Innovation](https://venturecafecambridge.org/event/charting-the-future-of-japanese-innovation/) seemed like a very interesting event to attend. Organized by Venture Cafe at the Cambridge Innovation Center, it run from 2-8pm.

It featured the University of Tokyo, UTokyo Innovation Platform Co (IPC), and the Greater Tokyo Biocommunity. They introduced 1stRound, UTokyo IPCâ€™s startup gateway program, discussed the trends of biotech ventures with global-facing life science entrepreneurs, and featured UTokyo President, Dr. Teruo Fujii. 

Then I took the subway back to the iLabs to join the LLX-GEO Alumni & Friends dinner at the Harvard Business School Spangler Center. It was a great opportunity for networking, with keynote speaker Will Ahmed, co-founder of Whoop, a venture that was an iLab member for years.

Here are [a few photos I took](https://photos.app.goo.gl/4yGVVtTveVxm4DVy8), but here are [many more official photos of the dinner](https://flickr.com/photos/harvardinnovationlabs/albums/72177720309393676/page1/).
