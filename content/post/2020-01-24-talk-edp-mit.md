[UPDATE: Video available] I'm honored to have been invited by Professor [Bill Aulet](https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/profile/bill-aulet/) to give a guest lecture to the [EDP (Entrepreneurship Development Program)](https://innovation.mit.edu/opportunity/entrepreneurship-development-program/) students at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) [Sloan Executive Education](https://executive.mit.edu/).

The talk, officially called *Celebration Lunch & Guest Speaker Jorge Cortell, Kanteron Systems (EDP 2013) "Where do you go from here?"* (but that I titled: "IDE Narrative: Myths, Memes, and Manipulation - Undressing a 'Successful Entrepreneur' in the age of Metamodernism") took place at MIT Media Lab, Building E14, 6th Floor Multipurpose Room: 75 Amherst Street, Cambridge, January 24th, 12:45-14:00h
