Since this week there are way too many art shows to visit, I`ll miss some, for sure.

Luckily, these events are getting better and better with their online access and info, and now we have <a title="https://ny.voltashow.com" href="https://ny.voltashow.com" target="_blank">Volta</a>â€˜s catalogue online:</p> 

We also have a good portion of <a title="https://www.thearmoryshow.com" href="https://www.thearmoryshow.com" target="_blank">Armory</a>â€˜s show <a title="https://artsy.net/thearmoryshow" href="https://artsy.net/thearmoryshow" target="_blank">online, by Artsy</a>.

Enjoy ðŸ˜‰
