A couple of weeks ago I received my new <a title="https://www.lytro.com/" href="https://www.lytro.com/" target="_blank">Lytro</a> camera. Although it is an incredible technology, and allows things that were unthinkable until now, so far I am mixed.

Pros:

  * Compact and discreet
  * Extremely easy to use
  * New ways of taking pictures
  * Novelty
  * Supercool "focus later"

Cons:

  * You have to get used to a different way of thinking and framing a shot (square! and distance)
  * Low performance under low light (although better than my crappy Samsung Galaxy IIS camera)

Check out <a title="https://pictures.lytro.com/jcortell/stories/38582" href="https://pictures.lytro.com/jcortell/stories/38582" target="_blank">this online gallery</a>. Click on different areas of the image, and see how it re-focus. Note:Â the "magic" happens in some pictures, while it does not in others, because it depends on the depth and elements in the shot. I do definitely need more practice.</p> 

I guess my old DSL can relax for a while. Big and heavy, but it is still the king when it comes to quality photographs.
