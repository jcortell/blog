Going to the beach and the pool every day is nice, but how about some evening fun in town?

<!--more-->

With my wife gone, cruising with her mother, I've been working (WFH), having lunch at the yacht club, and going to the beach and pool by myself. But there were two things that made me go out in the evening today:

* The very nice art exhibition 'Emergency on Planet Earth' at the [Carme Center for Contemporary Culture](https://www.consorcimuseus.gva.es/centro-del-carmen/), and a very nice tortilla from the Cafe Museu
* Going to the movies at the Rialto Film Center to watch the anime 'Eiga Odd Taxi: In the Woods 映画 「オッドタクシー イン・ザ・ウッズ'
