On Sunday, after returning to New York from the inaugural cruise, we went to Central Park to spend the afternoon and enjoy <a title="https://www.japandaynyc.org" href="https://www.japandaynyc.org" target="_blank">Japan Day</a>!

Tents with huge lines to get free Japanese food (udon, okonomiyaki, gyozas, panda chocolate snacks, tea...), activities (calligraphy, kimonos, origami, yoyo-fishing...) and performances (karate, taiko...), all very well organized and full of mostly Japanese people in a very fun and nice event.

There were even so many cosplayers that it reminded me of _Jing?bashi_ or Yoyogi park!!

Tanoshii!! ^_^
