I can think of worse places to have to spend 3 days working in than the Canary Islands ;-)

<!--more-->

For work, I traveled to the Canary Islands to meet Technology Transfer Officers (TTOs) and Scientists from two universities,and the health secretary of the regional government.

Monday June 27th I flew into Tenerife Norte, and stayed at the charming but basic (with sad breakfast) [Hotel Laguna Nivaria](https://www.lagunanivaria.com/en/) in La Laguna, to meet the TTO from La Laguna University on Tuesday morning. 

After the meeting, I went to have lunch at the deliciously local [Tasca el Faracho](https://es.restaurantguru.com/Tasca-Faracho-San-Cristobal-de-La-Laguna), and after a quick visit to the frescoes at the church Parroquia De Santo Domingo De Guzmán, I spent the rest of the day working from the hotel.

The next morning I flew from Tenerife Norte to Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (LPGC), where I met several TTOs and researchers from the LPGC University Healthcare Unit for several hours. Then went straight to another meeting, at the Regional Government Department of Health. After that I had a late but delicious lunch (including the typical papas arrugás con mojo) at [Allende Muelle Deportivo](https://www.allenderestauracion.com/restaurantes/allende-muelle/).

With some extra time before my flight, I took a walk along the coast to the historic downtown area of Triana, and then visited the [Atlantic Center for Modern Art](https://caam.net/) where I enjoyed the exhibitions on [Juan Hernández](https://www.caam.net/es/expos_int.php?n=4345) and [Myriam Mihindou](https://www.caam.net/es/expos_int.php?n=4343), although, honestly, I should rather have visited the one by [Arita Shahrzad](https://www.caam.net/es/expos_int.php?n=4331), but it was in the San Antonio Abad building and I missed it since I had to go to the airport to fly back to Tenerife.

The following day was a mess: RyanAir was on strike, and the TripCase application notified me of the cancellation of my flight, so I booked the last seat on a flight out of Tenerife Sur (one hour by bus) to Valencia via Madrid. Incredibly enough the flight was not cancelled, so now I'm left paying for two flights for fear of getting stuck. Oh, well, such is the life of a road warrior. At least I had some cuttlefish croquettes at the Dali lounge in the Madrid airport.
