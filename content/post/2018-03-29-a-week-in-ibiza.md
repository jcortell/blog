March 25 to 29 we "had to" accompany some friends visiting Ibiza (Spanish Balearic Island) from New York.

<!--more-->

Our friends Megan Roberts, a composer and media artist, and Raymond Ghirardo, a sculptor and media artist, [both](https://www.roberts-ghirardo.net) retired art professors from Ithaca College, parted Valencia after [visiting Fallas](https://blog.cortell.net/2018/03/fallas-with-friends/) with us. They spent a few days in Alicante, and then asked us to join them for almost a week in Ibiza. Twist my arm!!

Of course, Ibiza is my favourite place in the world, along with Japan. So I enjoyed tremendously.

After meeting them in Alicante, we drove to El Portet, in Moraira, to have an *almuerzo*, and then took the Ferry from Denia to Ibiza.

We stayed at the fabulous [Sir Joan Hotel](https://www.sirhotels.com/joan), next to Pacha. Since we took my car with the ferry, we travelled all over the island. After the obligatory visit to Dalt Vila, we ate at great places, from tapas bars to beach huts to Michelin Guide restaurants, like:

- El Zaguan
- Mar A Vila (amazing *pinchos*)
- El Bigotes (where the King of Spain was refused a table because he did not have a reservation ¡my kind of place!)
- S'Illa des Bosc

We even stopped by Es Cruce to buy some *flaó* And, of course, we enjoyed a walk on a few of my favorite little beaches or *calas*, like:

- Cala Xucla
- Cala Bassa
- Cala Comte
- Portinatx

The trip ended by enjoying the magical and famous Ibiza sunset from Cafe del Mar in Sant Antoni.

We're already planning to return, as soon as we can, and stay for as long as we can.
