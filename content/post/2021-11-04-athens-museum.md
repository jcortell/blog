Before returning home, we spent a day in Athens with two highlights: [the National Archaeological Museum](https://www.namuseum.gr/en/), and [Ta Karamanlidika tou Fani Meze Restaurant](https://karamanlidika.gr/en/meze-restaurant/) (Καραμανλίδικα του Φάνη).

After breakfast we sadly disembarked from our cruise, and went straight to check in at the [St George Lycabettus Hotel](https://www.sglycabettus.gr/). Without a doubt the best views of the Acropolis, and a nice hotel, but nothing else particularly special about it. We dropped our luggage and walk to our real destination: the National Archaeological Museum.

As you can imagine, endless hours can be spent in such a fascinating museum. The collection is unparalleled, and for an old public museum, is quite well organized and exhibited. We loved the visit. Too bad the opening hours are not more generous, but what you learn is priceless. Everything, from vases to sculptures, jewelry and glass, bronze and special collections (Prehistoric, Egyptian, Stathatos, Mycenaenan, Cyprus, Vlastos-Serpieris...) tells countless stories. What a wonderful way to absorb history! Our favourites were “[The Antikythera Shipwreck: The ship – the treasures – the Mechanism](https://www.namuseum.gr/en/temporary_exhibition/to-nayagio-ton-antikythiron-to-ploio-oi-thisayroi-o-michanismos/)” (lucky for us, extended) and the [Mycenaean Antiquities](https://www.namuseum.gr/en/permanent_exhibition/mykinaikes-archaiotites/).

After that museistic overdose, we took a walk around the city, towards the Central Market and our dinner destination: the extremely charming Ta Karamanlidika tou Fani Meze Restaurant.

The next day we flew home, exhausted, but having formed many wonderful forever-memories.
