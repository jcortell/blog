Two interesting days, as explained in my Harvard Blog: [Field X](https://blogs.harvard.edu/jorgecortell/2022/11/29/invited-to-judge-startup-projects-for-the-field-x-pitch-day/) and [Gong-a-thon](https://blogs.harvard.edu/jorgecortell/2022/12/01/celebrating-the-harvard-innovation-labs-gong-a-thon/).

On November 29th, I had the honor to be invited by Professor Randolph Cohen to judge [Field X](https://www.hbs.edu/coursecatalog/6333.html) student startup project pitches at [Harvard Business School](https://www.hbs.edu/). It was fascinating to see all those talented students pitch their project. While most were very early on, barely more than an idea, some had a lot of potential and very motivated teams behind it.

Then, on December 1st, the [Harvard Innovation Labs](https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/) invited me to join their annual Gong-a-thon celebration, held at the [Queen’s Head Pub](https://cqh.harvard.edu/), where different teams share the joy of their progress, learnings, and the whole community enjoys food and fun.

It was very enjoyable, and a wonderful opportunity to catch up in a very social setting. 

Thank you both!
