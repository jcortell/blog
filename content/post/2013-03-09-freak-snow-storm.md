On Thursday I woke up to a message from a friend, professor at MIT, who was flying to SXSW and was stuck onboard the plane with the Boston airport closed. We had a freak snow storm: it started snowing in the morning. The snow accumulated throughout the day. By night it stopped and temperatures went up. In two days we have gone from 20ÂºF to 54ÂºF. New York weather: unpredictable and not for the faint of heart ðŸ˜‰
