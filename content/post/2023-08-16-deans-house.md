August 16th I was invited for an afternoon break at the Harvard Business School Dean's House.

These weeks of August find many of us immersed in preparations for the approaching academic yearâ€”from welcoming new faculty and students, to managing the logistics of start-up. And, with Executive Education and HBS Online (and many other activities) in full swing year-round, ours is a campus always bustling with energy.

The break at the Dean's House was an opportunity to catch up with colleagues and friends. We had a make-your-own shortcake bar in the green behind the house. I was a treat to spend time together and hear what everyone's been up to this summer.
