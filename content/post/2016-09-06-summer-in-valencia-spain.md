We spent the last days of July, and most of August in Valencia (Spain). Here are some "public" highlights, besides many evenings at the swimming pool and beach (plus many more "private" ones, enjoying with the family and kids):

In July we had tapas at [Central Bar](https://www.centralbar.es/), visited the Torres de Serranos, and went to [Viva Tapas Bar](https://vivatapasbarvalencia.com/) with friends.

In August we celebrated our anniversary at [Ma Khin Café](https://www.makhincafe.com/) (nice, but we ended up there because our first four choices were closed), took John, a friend, to [Bodego de la Sarieta](https://www.bodegodelasarieta.com/), had cava sangria at the [Cafe Negrito](https://www.facebook.com/CafeNegritoValencia), and visited the [Saint Nicholas church](https://www.sannicolasvalencia.com/).

The first days of September, before heading back to London, we had lunch and chilled at [Marina Beach Club](https://marinabeachclub.com/en/), attended the 400 paella party in Puçol, taught the kids how to do graffiti, attended the conservatory auditions, had lunch at the [Institut Français](https://www.institutfrancais.es/valencia/), and visited the mosaic room of the North Station and the City Hall`s Mirror Room and Mayor`s Balcony.
