In order to provide some consulting to a large public corporation in Thailand, I was invited to travel to Bangkok for two weeks.

<!--more-->

I love traveling, Asia, Thailand, and Bangkok. So I was more than happy to take a Qatar Airways business flight to the other side of the world (Boston-Doha with the obligatory pit stop at the Al Mourjan Business Lounge-Bangkok), staying at the [JWMarriott](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/bkkdt-jw-marriott-hotel-bangkok/) right across the street from the infamous Nana Entertainment Center, during Monsoon season, and spend several days in business meetings and brainstorming sessions.

But it wasn't all work and meetings, although almost. I also visited the [BACC](https://en.bacc.or.th/) (Bangkok Art and Culture Center), went shopping (MBK, Paragon, JJ/Chatuchak), and had delicious street food (and indoor food too, like Michelin-guide recommended noodles by Lim Lao Ngow).

One particularly mention-worthy event was meeting the very talented Georgian bodybuilder and artist Lash, who hand painted some sneakers specially for me. Thank you, Lash!
