Monkeying around is fun. Particularly when it's with your colleagues as part of your job.

On June 13th just about the whole team from the Harvard iLabs went to [Tree Top Adventures](https://treetopcanton.com/) for a team-building day.

TreeTop Adventures is a high ropes and obstacle course located just 30 minutes south of Boston in Canton, MA. The high ropes + obstacle course includes 10 Trails and 27 Zip-lines, ranging in difficulty level from beginner to expert and consist of obstacles like rolling logs, bridges, ladders, tight ropes, zip-lines...

We participated in group activities at first, which were a lot of fun, and then went onto the courses. I managed to complete the expert level one, including a section (vertical logs) that apparently it's almost impossible to cross without help. But I guess the competitiveness of my basketball days (or is it from my startup days?) is still burning in me :D

Of course, once done with the trees, we had to quench out thirst at [Trillium](https://trilliumbrewing.com/pages/canton).
