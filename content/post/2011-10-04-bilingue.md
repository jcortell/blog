Since I will be moving to New York in a month, I have decided to make this blogÂ bilingual. In doing so, I have wanted to mark all untraslated entries (almost 2000 of them) just in case some day I might think about translating them. That`s why the pesky (English) next to the title of previous entries shows when the blog is shown in Spanish.
