We had the pleasure to spend the second half of March with the kids and the rest of the family in Valencia (Spain).

My Canadian in-laws had never seen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falles" target="_blank">Fallas</a>, the crazy annual festival that leaves the whole city literally up in flames every March 19th, after over a week of outdoor concerts, food, parades, firecrackers and fireworks.

We enjoyed paella, "chocolate con bu√±uelos", live flamenco... but without a doubt, the highlight was to be able to experience the ‚Äúmasclet√°‚Äù firecracker extravaganza from the most vantage position: the balcony of a private bank‚Äôs offices in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento (thanks again, Antonio!). Our ribs definitely felt like they were going to break from all those explosions! üôÇ
