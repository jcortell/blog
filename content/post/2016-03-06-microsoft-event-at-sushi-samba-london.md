On February 23 Microsoft invited me to an industry event at Sushi Samba, which is located on the 39th floor of the Heron Tower in London.

I have never given a standing presentation right next to a floor to ceiling window with the clouds closer to me than the ground!

The event was nice, as it was the venue. Thank you for inviting me, Microsoft.
