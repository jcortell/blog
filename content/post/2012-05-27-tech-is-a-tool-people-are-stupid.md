Technology is getting easier to use everyday. Take GNU/Linux distributions as an example: anyone can make their own. Does that mean everyone should make their own? Why not? But then, again, we end up with things like <a title="https://ubuntusatanic.org/" href="https://ubuntusatanic.org/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Satanic</a> (and their Ubuntu SE 666.10 “Necrophiliac Neuromancer”), <a title="https://hannahmontana.sourceforge.net/index.html" href="https://hannahmontana.sourceforge.net/index.html" target="_blank">Hannah Montana Linux</a> (how far would you go to attract kids to free software?), or <a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Star_OS" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Star_OS" target="_blank">Red Star OS</a> (free software for North Korea and non-free browsing? WTF?).

Shouldn`t people invest their time in more productive/interesting/fun things? 

Of course, governments have their own agendas when it comes to developing and using technology. Here are a few examples: from the brainwashing efforts of <a title="https://www.ready.gov/" href="https://www.ready.gov/" target="_blank">Ready.gov</a> (with the section Ready Kids explaining all the scary things that can happen to your family), to the Dept. of the Treasury in their <a title="https://www.treasurydirect.gov/kids/kids.htm" href="https://www.treasurydirect.gov/kids/kids.htm" target="_blank">Treasury Direct Kids</a> talking about "inflation-protected securities", the <a title="https://www.bep.treas.gov/home.html" href="https://www.bep.treas.gov/home.html" target="_blank">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</a> where you can buy limited edition currency (sic), the <a title="https://www.usoge.gov/" href="https://www.usoge.gov/" target="_blank">Office for Government Ethics</a> (probably the least visited website on Earth), or the Star Wars missile initiative at the <a title="https://www.mda.mil/" href="https://www.mda.mil/" target="_blank">Missile Defense Agency</a>. I guess when you believe the whole world is yours (DoD <a title="https://www.defense.gov/home/features/2009/0109_unifiedcommand/" href="https://www.defense.gov/home/features/2009/0109_unifiedcommand/" target="_blank">Unified Command Plan</a>), anything goes. <a title="https://www.makeuseof.com" href="https://www.makeuseof.com" target="_blank">Source</a>.
