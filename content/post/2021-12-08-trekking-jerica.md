Sometimes backyard excursions are as awesome as faraway lands. Today we went to visit the murals in Geldo and trekking in Jerica.

<!--more-->

Geldo is a 650 people village half an hour away that has decided to beautify their unused walls by commissioning some impressive murals.

A mere 40 minutes from where we live, Jerica has a nice riverside walk for trekking and cliffs for rock climbing.

Combining both with lunch in Algar, we ended up having a very nice afternoon with the little one and my parents. We wrapped up the day having hot cocoa (so dense it's like chocolate pudding in a cup) with churros at home, with the fireplace on and the cats purring.
