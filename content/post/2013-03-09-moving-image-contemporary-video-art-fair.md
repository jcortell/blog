A couple days ago we were invited to the inauguration of <a title="https://www.moving-image.info" href="https://www.moving-image.info" target="_blank">Moving Image</a> contemporary video art fair at the Terminal Stores (Waterfront Tunnel).

Interesting initiative, in a spectacular space, but as always some works were more appealing than others. This time, without a doubt, the only ones that I would definitely recommend are the ones shown by <a title="https://tedvictoria.com" href="https://tedvictoria.com" target="_blank">Ted Victoria</a> (represented by <a title="https://srandsgallery.com/index.php?/artists/ted_victoria/works/" href="https://srandsgallery.com/index.php?/artists/ted_victoria/works/" target="_blank">Schröder Romero & Shredder</a>). Very objectual, but quite imaginative and evocative.

Also worth mentioning is the initiative of Hanna Maria Anttila (Director of the <a title="https://www.av-arkki.fi" href="https://www.av-arkki.fi" target="_blank">AV-Arkki</a>, the Distribution Center for Finnish Media Art) to freely distribute the works in a DVD and online.
