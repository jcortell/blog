On March 6th we were invited, along with my wife, my friend the artist Claudio Zirotti, and his wife, to the opening of the art show “<a href="https://www.europapress.es/comunitat-valenciana/noticia-cultura-exposicion-multidisciplinar-muestra-duenas-arte-atarazanas-20150306155846.html" title="https://www.europapress.es/comunitat-valenciana/noticia-cultura-exposicion-multidisciplinar-muestra-duenas-arte-atarazanas-20150306155846.html" target="_blank">(Female) Art Owners</a>” at the Atarazanas building in Valencia.

After the show we had a nice dinner in downtown Valencia, where we talked about the collective art exhibition I am putting together for next year in New York and London.
