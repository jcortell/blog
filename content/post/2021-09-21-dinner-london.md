On Tuesday I flew to London for the day to have dinner at Mosimann's with with Dr. Omar Ishrak, Intel's Chairman and former CEO of Medtronic and GE Healthcare, and Lord David Prior, NHS England Chairman.

Tuesday was a busy day. Not only I [walked a lot and visited several museums](https://blog.cortell.net/2021/09/a-day-of-art-in-london/). I also met some very interesting people, like Ali Ojjeh (Chairman of Northgate, $4.8bn in VC and PE), Igor and Dmitry Bukhman (multibillionaire owners of world's third largest mobile game company Playrix), the former UK Trade Commissioner at the EU (clearly anti-Brexit), and the Head of Global Family Office at UBS.

The main meeting happened during a delicious but not particularly sophisticated dinner at [Mosimann's](https://www.mosimann.com/), the club founded by Anton Mosimann OBE, two Michelin star chef when he led the Dorchester Hotel restaurant, that has served royalties from over a dozen countries, and has cooked for the British royal family for many years.

Dr. Omar Ishrak is Intelâ€™s Chairman of the board. Previously, he was chairman and CEO of Medtronic and president and CEO of GE Healthcare Systems.

David Gifford Leathes Prior, Baron Prior of Brampton, is chairman of NHS England, chairman of University College Hospital, and a life peer in the House of Lords. Previously he was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health in David Cameron's Conservative ministry, and a former Norfolk MP and hospital chairman. He has also been the Chief Executive of the Conservative Party.

The conversation we had is obviously confidential, but it was extremely interesting.
