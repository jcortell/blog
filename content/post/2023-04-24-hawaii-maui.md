To celebrate my birthday and my new position at Harvard, I spent a week in Maui, Hawaii, with my girls.

After landing in Kahului airport on Monday, April 17th, we took our rental Jeep, and drove straight to the condo we had rented in Wailea, stopping at the supermarket. Before going to bed we watched the sunset from the Kamaole Beach Park.

Here are some [photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/dFMgqmKjh5q2Xjho8) of the first day.

The next day we started the day by inspecting [The Westin Maui Resort & Spa, Ka'anapali](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/hnmwi-the-westin-maui-resort-and-spa-kaanapali/overview/?scid=f2ae0541-1279-4f24-b197-a979c79310b0). After that we had lunch by the ocean in [Lahaina Fish Co.](https://www.lahainafishco.com/), swam in Hokolua-Mokuleia Bay, and finished the day at [Kepaniwai Park](https://www.mauicounty.gov/facilities/facility/details/Kepaniwai-Park-401) heritage themed gardens celebrating Hawaii's culture. [Update from August: it's heartbreaking to see how Lahaina has been destroyed by wildfires].

Here are some [photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/mC5vYFRTkCYTio3o6) of Tuesday.

Wednesday April 19th we inspected the [Fairmont Kea Lani Maui](https://www.fairmont.com/kea-lani-maui/) in the morning, and the [Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea](https://www.fourseasons.com/maui/) in the evening. Since it started to rain, and we liked their infinity pool so much, we returned the next morning!

Thursday, April 20th, we inspected the sophisticated [Montage Kapalua Bay](https://www.montagehotels.com/kapaluabay/) with a most gorgeous location, and the [Ritz-Carlton Kapalua](https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/jhmrz-the-ritz-carlton-maui-kapalua/overview/). It was so beautiful most of [Thursday's pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/5o5jxtvY7PGvUWLy5) look like postcards!

On Friday, before the last inspection of the trip, the secluded [Hana-Maui Resort](https://www.hanamauiresort.com/), we drove through the Road to Hana: Waikamoi Nature Trail, many falls (Upper Waikani, Hanawi, Wailua, etc), stopped at the photogenic red and black sand Koki beach. Incredible beauty all around. Just look at [Friday's pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ra4zi8oFF9cK4tHQA).

On Saturday we returned to Honolua Bay, and had dinner at [Gannon's](https://gannonsrestaurant.com/), watching a stunning Hawaiian sunset. Here are [a few pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/oCQRYtqdFmLs9Lnh6).

Finally, on Sunday we walked around Paia, went to Ho'okipa, a windsurfing beach with turtles, had lunch at [Monkeypod Kitchen](https://monkeypodkitchen.com), and surfed in Baldwin Beach. Check out the [pictures here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/GXQ3zHf6n4E4TmHi6).

An absolutely magical trip to paradise.
