The first day of our 7 night Med cruise onboard Regent's Seven Seas Splendor took us to the Greek island of Lesbos.

On Friday we anchored off Mytilini, Lesbos, and tendered ashore for an excursion that took us to Kagiani Church, and then to the adorably picturesque and quaint tiny town of Agiasos, where we had a *kainapi* (kaynari, an infusion of a variety of spices and a total of nine herbs with a rich red color) and a super delicious *galaktoboureko* (a semolina custard dessert, baked between phyllo dough, then drenched in a scented syrup). Back in Mytilini we walked around town, and then tendered back to the ship, where we got dressed to respect the elegant casual dress code, and had dinner at Compass Rose, the largest specialty restaurant in their fleet, with chandeliers, Versace tableware, and amazing food.
