A couple weeks ago I was at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. Of course, when I arrive in an airport with enough time ahead of my boarding, I look for a plug and wifi. Luckily Schiphol is an excellent airport, offering both. The only problem is that every time I clicked on the "Enjoy unlimited free wifi – Connect" button, I got an "Unknown error 0" message back.

> Don`t tell me "Enjoy unlimited free wifi" and then try to prevent me from accessing it. That is cruel and just wrong. I was told to "Enjoy unlimited free wifi", so I had to. To celebrate Free Software Day, you know.

I looked into the code, and saw an error. But luckily I also saw the way to by-pass it. All you have to do is to manually enter the correct URL, select the "Internet Voucher" option, and enter "schipholfreaccess" in both the ID and password fields (and accept the conditions). It will not give you an access screen, but you will be able to "Enjoy unlimited free wifi".

Who said hackers are not obedient?
