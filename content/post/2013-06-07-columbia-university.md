After a work meeting (and seeing a colorful piano, being fine tuned, in a public space)

I took the opportunity to visit Columbia University (it was about time).

The first building I enter is called "The Library at Columbia University". But, alas, is not a library!

It ceased to be a library in the late 30s, and now happens to be the Administrative Offices. Across the lawn, where students and visitors were chilling out and enjoying the sunny day, I find one of the many libraries:

After touring a few more buildings, I took the red line home. But I know I will be back.
