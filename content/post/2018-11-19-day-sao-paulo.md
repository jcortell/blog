November 19 I went to São Paulo, for a few business meetings.

<!--more-->

It was a quick fly-in, meeting, business lunch, meeting, meeting, airport to fly-out. All I saw were business people, rain and traffic.

At least the VIP Lounge at the GRU airport was nice (it even had polenta, pão de queijo, and many other yummies). But be careful if you have to go from one terminal to the next, as the distances are large!
