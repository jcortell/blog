I have business meetings all the time. Sometimes in person, sometimes via videoconference.
  
Itâ€™s always about the people you meet, and the business you discuss. But sometimes, the location is extraordinary, or fun, or interesting for whatever reason. So once in a while I will add a few comments or pictures about those meetings. For example, check out the views from the 32nd floor of the Tower 42 building, or the reception room of the Royal Institute of British Architects!
