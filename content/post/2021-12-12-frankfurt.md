My wife and daughter had never been to Frankfurt (Germany). One wanted to inspect a couple properties, the other wanted to visit the Christmas market. We received a nice invitation by the [Villa Kennedy hotel](https://www.roccofortehotels.com/hotels-and-resorts/villa-kennedy/), so we decided to spend the weekend in Frankfurt.

We arrived Friday night and went straight to sleep. The [Villa Kennedy hotel](https://www.roccofortehotels.com/hotels-and-resorts/villa-kennedy/) is a gorgeous castle near downtown Frankfurt. We loved the elegance of the hotel, and the coziness of our room.

The next morning we had breakfast in their limited but good buffet, and headed off to inspect the [Steigenberger Frankfurter Hof](https://www.steigenberger.com/en/hotels/all-hotels/germany/frankfurt/steigenberger-frankfurter-hof), the other most luxurious hotel in the city.

Better located downtown, more classical, a bit more dated, but some of the suites, like the Presidential and the Royal (where the Rolling Stones stayed not long ago), and the main meeting space, were breathtaking. The restaurants were also top notch, not only the obvious Michelin-starred *Restaurant Français* but also *Oscar's*, where we were invited to have a delicious lunch.

Hommage Gentlemen's Barber was also a surprise: a celebrity barber, that hosts private small events with champagne, cocktails, and caviar...

After the site inspection we walked to the [Kleinmarkthalle](https://kleinmarkthalle.de/), with many food options, but we were too full to eat anything, so we continued towards the Dom Cathedral, walked around the Christmas Market (more food than anything else, and way too crowded for these Covid19 times) in the Römer area, took a break and a chai latte at [Café Hauptwache](https://www.cafe-hauptwache.de/), and walked back to our hotel via the Museum Embankment and Schaumainkai.

On Sunday morning we had a tour of our hotel, where, incidentally, the Bayer 04 Leverkusen soccer team was staying. The little huts set up in the courtyard were really adorable, but what we enjoyed the most was the swimming pool (although the water was a bit cold).

A short but very enjoyable weekend getaway.
