So, Sunday came and my feet were already trembling scared in anticipation of another art overdose. Let`s go!

I spent the morning walking around some of Manhattan`s Lower East Side (LES) galleries with artist <a title="https://leewells.org/home/" href="https://leewells.org/home/" target="_blank">Lee Wells</a>. We visited <a title="https://www.roostergallery.com/" href="https://www.roostergallery.com/" target="_blank">Rooster Gallery</a>, <a title="https://www.anastasia-photo.com/" href="https://www.anastasia-photo.com/" target="_blank">Anastasia Photo</a>, <a title="https://bridgegalleryny.com/home.html" href="https://bridgegalleryny.com/home.html" target="_blank">Bridge Gallery</a>, <a title="https://www.maysongallery.com/" href="https://www.maysongallery.com/" target="_blank">Mayson Gallery</a>, <a title="https://lesleyheller.com/" href="https://lesleyheller.com/" target="_blank">Lesley Heller Workspace</a>, and <a title="https://www.scaramoucheart.com/" href="https://www.scaramoucheart.com/" target="_blank">Scaramouche</a>. We talked with the owners and saw the works displayed (honestly: I only liked a few, namely what was on display at Anastasia, and Bridge, but these people artist-gallerist do cover each others` backs pretty closely), before heading for <a title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teany" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teany" target="_blank">Teany</a> for lunch, tea and cake. The extra sugar was needed, because with the afternoon came...

<a title="https://voltashow.com/Home.5726.0.html" href="https://voltashow.com/Home.5726.0.html" target="_blank">Volta NY 2012</a>: an invitational solo project fair for contemporary art.

Although smaller that Armory, and definitely with lesser known names, the fair was packed with <a title="Volta 2012 Catalogue in PDF" href="https://voltashow.com/fileadmin/volta/VOLTA_NY_2012/Press/VNY_2012_catalog_3_Low.pdf" target="_blank">sensational art</a> and surprises (like <a title="https://www.khaismanstudio.com/" href="https://www.khaismanstudio.com/" target="_blank">Mark Khaisman</a>‘s portraits made with duck tape, <a title="https://www.cultureshockny.com/" href="https://www.cultureshockny.com/" target="_blank">CultureShock</a>‘s boomboxes and iPad music making soft, or the <a title="https://www.homebaseproject.org/ignatz-bier/" href="https://www.homebaseproject.org/ignatz-bier/" target="_blank">Home Base`s Ignatz Bier</a> project). Besides, I had the pleasure to talk with my favorite artist at that show: Ken Matsubara and Shin Il Kim.

Ken Matsubara (Ma2Gallery, Tokyo) presented some incredibly sensitive and ethereal works, floating in mirrors and displays, that were highly hypnotic. More over, his (and Masami`s) Japanese humble attitude was also a real pleasure.

Shin Il Kim (Gallery Simon, Seoul) works with plastics, with very unconventional and extremely appealing results. He was kind enough to explain the creation and production process to me. _Kamsamnida_!

Again, the feeling that art, to me, is like basketball: watching it only inspires and motivates me to want to do it myself. You can theorize and philosophize about it all day long. But when you get your hands dirty, is when the real fun happens.
