Taking advantage of the excellent weather, I've been visiting some museums lately: Boston's [Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.mfa.org/), [Institute of Contemporary Art](https://www.icaboston.org/), [Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/), and [Harvard Museum of Natural History](https://hmnh.harvard.edu/).

On Saturday, August 26th, I went to Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art. The museum was founded as the Boston Museum of Modern Art in 1936. Since then it has gone through multiple name changes as well as moving its galleries and support spaces over 13 times. Its current home was built in 2006 in the South Boston Seaport District. The collection is quite small for such a big building, but I mus admit I enjoyed it (particularly the Simone Leigh exhibition). 

Here are [some pictures of the day](https://photos.app.goo.gl/ZAQBfLeS9WByfL7P8).

On Saturday, September 2nd, I had timed-entry tickets to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. The dream (or nightmare) of a rich compulsive Art and artifact American collector, housed in a *faux palazzo* without any references to the works exhibited, and arranged just as the generous donor chose to display it. Not my cup of team, but quite curious and *instagrammable*.

After the slightly disappointing ISGM, I went to the Museum of Fine Arts, which I really enjoyed. A world class museum which reminds me of New York's MET or the British Museum. It is the 20th-largest art museum in the world, measured by public gallery area. It contains 8,161 paintings and more than 450,000 works of art, making it one of the most comprehensive collections in the Americas. The collection is so varied, that there's something for everyone. And having the subway station right across the street makes it easy to visit.

Today, I decided to go to the Harvard Museum of Natural History. There's much more to it than the world famous glass flowers (particularly the geology section), but those glass flowers are absolutely incredible!
