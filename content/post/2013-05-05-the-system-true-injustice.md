One of the friends having dinner with us <a title="https://cortell.net/blog/2013/05/ny-shorewalkers-the-great-saunter-2013/" href="https://cortell.net/blog/2013/05/ny-shorewalkers-the-great-saunter-2013/" target="_blank">yesterday</a> was a lawyer that used to be a Public Defender in NY. Of all the many interesting stories she had to tell, one struck me as the perfect example of all that is wrong with The System.

> Once she had to defend a homeless man who was accused of stealing a candy bar from a drugstore. Since he had breached a non-trespass order from a previous similar incident, the prosecutor was asking for a 3 year prison sentence. Regardless of the fact that the accused was mentally ill AND a diabetic who could not afford medication and was trying to control sugar levels with candy intake.

At the same time there was a another trial going on: a "white-collar" criminal who had raided a pension fund, leaving thousands of people with nothing to live on after they retired. All the prosecution was asking for was a large (but not to him) fine.

In <a title="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/world/europe/in-lean-years-after-boom-spains-graft-laid-bare.html" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/world/europe/in-lean-years-after-boom-spains-graft-laid-bare.html" target="_blank">Spain, where political and white-collar corruption is sadly rampant</a> even as unemployment rises above 27%, we have had our share of those extremely unfair cases (from Roldan to Rato).

While knee-jerk reactions to unusual exceptions are not a good way to conduct politics, we owe it to ourselves to make sure The System never becomes an excuse and mechanism for injustice. Specially social injustice.
