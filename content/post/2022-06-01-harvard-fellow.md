It's finally official: I have been appointed Innovation Fellow by Harvard University, so I'll be moving with my family to Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA) this Summer.

<!--more-->

I'm incredibly honored and excited to share my official appointment as an Innovation Fellow of the [John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS)](https://seas.harvard.edu/) at the [Technology and Entrepreneurship Center (TECH)](https://tech.seas.harvard.edu/) [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), working on healthtech venture development and life science innovation.

Of course, I will also remain a Venture Partner at NLC - The European Healthtech Venture Builder.

See you in Harvard!
