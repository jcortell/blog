A day in Padova (Padua), visiting the Basilica di Sant'Antonio and its amazing frescoes.

<!--more-->

The day started working from the stateroom, but as soon as I was done with my meetings, we hopped on a bus and went to town.

Padova is a very nice city. Our guide took us from Caff√® Pedrocchi all the way to the really memorable Basilica di Sant'Antonio, with several stops on the way.

We made fun of the fact that Italians are shameless about selling. For example, the guide admitted to have made up a couple of "historical facts" (about Galileo's podium at the University, and about Dante's house). She laughed about it when confronted with the real facts and her lack of evidence. Because, after all, it's all a story, rather than history, right?
