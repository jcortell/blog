I took a "long layover" in Amsterdam on the way back from Dubai that allowed me to go to the office two days.

I stayed at the same hotel as usual, and had dinner with some colleagues at [De Proefzaak](https://deproefzaak.nl/en/). Other than that, business as usual (loving it, and with the wonderful bonus of working for a B Corp that is making a huge impact on patients and inventors' lives).
