A friend got me a VIP pass for the <a title="https://scope-art.com/shows/basel-2014/about/" href="https://scope-art.com/shows/basel-2014/about/" target="_blank">2014 Scope Basel Art Show</a> (thank you, Jorge!). I had it all planned out: since I had a meeting in Stuttgart the day before, I could drive to nearby Basel, attend the VIP opening, and then fly back to New York. But the Stuttgart meeting was cancelled, so I changed my plane ticket, and returned to New York in time to go to the <a title="https://bricartsmedia.org/events/amos-lee-lake-street-dive" href="https://bricartsmedia.org/events/amos-lee-lake-street-dive" target="_blank">Amos Lee concert in Brooklyn`s Prospect Park</a> with my wife.

Life`s pleasures should always be shared, and there is no shortage of them.
