After Amsterdam, I flew to Valencia to participate in two events, as speaker and juror.

Thursday October 20, at the [Biohub VLC](https://biohubvlc.es/) I was asked to participate at the [VLC health & I](https://vlchealth.com/) regional health innovation event as [juror of the startup competition](https://vlchealth.com/jurado/). Here are [some photos of the event](https://vlchealth.com/galeria/) and a [video](https://youtu.be/aFCY6kU3IC0).

And on Tuesday October 25 (after a fabulous guest reception the previous night at the [L'Hemisf√®ric](https://www.cac.es/en/hemisferic/descubre-el-hemisferic/descubre-el-hemisferic.html)), I was asked to be a [speaker](https://valenciadigitalsummit.com/speakers/) at the fifth edition of [Valencia Digital Summit](https://valenciadigitalsummit.com/), which took place at the [Museum of Arts](https://www.cac.es/en/museu-de-les-ciencies/museu-de-les-ciencies/descubre-el-museu.html): over 12,000 attendees from 35 different countries, more than 400 national and international investors and 450 world-renowned speakers, around 1,500 startups, and over 130 sessions on various topics such as sustainability, blockchain technology, smart cities, talent acquisition and corporate-startup collaboration.
