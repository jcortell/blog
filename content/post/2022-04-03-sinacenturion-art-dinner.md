April 3rd we disembarked the cruise and took a stylish water taxi to our next hotel: the [Sina Centurion Palace](https://www.sinahotels.com/en/h/sina-centurion-palace-venice/). Then we spent the rest of the day enjoying more art and a wonderful dinner.

The Sina Centurion Palace is a luxury hotel with doble height ceilings and a view directly into the Grand Canal. It's so cool you're tempted to just stay in the room all day, looking though the window. But of course, we decided to go out and enjoy the beauty of Venice.

First we walked around, doing some shopping and getting to the Rialto Bridge. Then we went into the [Chiesa di Santo  Stefano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Stefano,_Venice) (which has The Last Supper by Jacopo Tintoretto), and spent most of the day at the [Gallerie dell'Accademia](https://gallerieaccademia.it/) admiring an incredible collection of all the Italian Renaissance Masterpieces you can think of, including one of my favourites: Tintoretto's "feminist" 'St Louis St George and the Princess'.

To top a perfect day, my dear wife took us to [Osteria Antico Giardinetto](http://www.anticogiardinetto.it/), where Larisa and Virgilio managed to impress me with their local home made food. VERY delicious!
