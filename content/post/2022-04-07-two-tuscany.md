To relax after the wild party in Venice, we were invited to spend a couple days at the [Relais Villa Olmo](https://www.relaisvillaolmo.com/en/) in Tuscany with some friends.

Our Tuscan villa was delightful, a romanticized version of country living, complete with its own vineyard, winery, and olive oil production.

The food, of course, was excellent, and the service very kind. But it was being with such a nice group of friends (from Las Vegas, Abu Dhabi, Alicante, Florence, New York...) what made it particularly enjoyable.
