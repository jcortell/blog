After all this traveling and going out, it feels wonderful to spend some time at home.

Some things I have been enjoying this week:

  * Hanging the art piece <a title="https://mery.cortell.net/" href="https://mery.cortell.net/" target="_blank">my sister</a> painted for (and titled after) my wife. By the way, congratulations on your latest solo exhibition, sis!
  * My wife`s cooking: Amazing and unique caribbean stew, banana-chocolate-coconut cake...
  * Reading (Simone de Beauvoir, Douglas Hofstadter...)
  * Watching The Newsroom season 2 and some How I met your mother

Traveling, going out and business is all good and fun. But some homey-cozy is also delightful.
