On Thursday, we docked in Cadiz.

<!--more-->

Cadiz is a sweet little ton that can be explored on foot in an afternoon. So that's what we did.

The ship docked right next to downtown, so we walked off and into town, being greeted by a pretty good guitarist performing at the Plaza de San Juan de Dios, next to the City-hall. From there we walked to the Municipal Market via the Flowers Square. At the market, we marveled at their amazing selection of fish and seafood, and were tempted to buy some of their famous shrimps to have them cooked by ne of the bars on the side of the market, which only charge 3 euros to do so. But we decided to keep on walking, passing by a ton of bars offering really really good tapas. We did buy a cheese, that has won [one of this year's World Cheese Awards gold medals](https://www.directoalpaladar.com/ingredientes-y-alimentos/27-mejores-quesos-espanoles-premiados-world-cheese-awards-como-donde-comprarlos) and can not be bought online or any regular store: a Payoyo Goat cheese cured over 6 months with rosemary and honey. Delicious!

Upon returning to the ship, my wife worked a bit while I read, and then we went to have dinner at the Japanese restaurant Seishin, where everything was delicious, but the tempura crab and matcha molten cake were exceptional.
