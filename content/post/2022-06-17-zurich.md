I had to spend two days in Zürich, Switzerland, for work.

<!--more-->

Upon arrival I went to have dinner with some friends at [Cantinetta Antinori](https://www.bindella.ch/gastronomie/cantinetta-antinori).

But I wasn't there just for fun. As a matter of fact, during this trip I didn't even have time to go to a museum or art gallery!

First I visited IBM Research in Rüschlikon. Rüschlikon is a quaint little town near Zürich, with beautiful grassy hills with cows by the lake.

Then I met with an engineering company and investment group in Zürich.

The only few minutes I had to myself I spent in a... great [Mexican Restaurant](https://www.lataqueria.ch/)!
