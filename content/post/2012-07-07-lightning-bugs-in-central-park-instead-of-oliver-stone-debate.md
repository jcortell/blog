Yesterday I was invited to a member`s only screening of _Born on the Fourth of July_ (1989) and post-screening discussion with Oliver Stone and Ron Kovic at MoMA Film Theater 1.

What do I do instead? I end up at Central Park, with lightning bugs around me. I think I am still there. For some reason, I have gotten trapped there, and I do not want to leave.
