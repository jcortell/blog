I use _qtranslate_ as a multi-language plugin for my blog. It`s an excellent solution, but the problem is that everytime Word Press is updated, it takes days, and sometimes weeeks, for the plugin author to update it.

So, tired of waiting, I have found a quick and simple hack to make it work with the latests WP 3.8 update: edit qtranslate.php to

> define(â€˜QT\_SUPPORTED\_WP_VERSION`, â€˜3.8`);

You`re welcome ðŸ˜‰
