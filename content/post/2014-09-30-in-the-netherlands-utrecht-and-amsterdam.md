As soon as I arrived in Utrecht, Diederik took me to a lunch at a very nice restaurant, inside an industrial complex: <a title="https://www.zuivergastvrij.nl/" href="https://www.zuivergastvrij.nl/" target="_blank">Zuiver</a>. Both him and the waiter suggested the smoked eel salad, and I must agree, it was delicious.
  
Then, after a couple of very interesting meetings, he took me to dinner to another very nice restaurant, this time in the colorful and very touristy Red Light District: <a title="https://www.restaurantanna.nl/en" href="https://www.restaurantanna.nl/en" target="_blank">ANNA</a>, where we had pre-appetizer, appetizer, main course, pre-dessert, and dessert.

Back in the hotel room, I found this interesting "no weed smoking allowed in the room" notice:

The next day I had a meeting at IBM Netherlands. The surprise came after the meeting: outdoors BBQ party, with DJ!

The best thing was that I finally had a chance to try one of the culinary creations of IBM‚Äôs Watson Cognitive Computer. It was a ‚Äú<a title="https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/07/01/327204491/ibms-watson-is-out-with-its-own-barbecue-sauce" href="https://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/07/01/327204491/ibms-watson-is-out-with-its-own-barbecue-sauce" target="_blank">Bengali Butternut BBQ Sauce</a>‚Äù. It was definitely different, and delicious. Apparently I was not the only one who <a title="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3027687/i-tasted-bbq-sauce-made-by-ibms-watson-and-loved-it" href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3027687/i-tasted-bbq-sauce-made-by-ibms-watson-and-loved-it" target="_blank">liked it</a>!
