Since we were alone for a few days, my dear wife and I went to town for a day of art at the Tate and Globe Theater.

At the Tate we enjoyed, as usual, their exhibition. They keep changing and rearranging by concept, and it's always a pleasure.

What was new for me (not for my wife) was attending a theater play at the Globe Theater, a very faithful reproduction of the original Shakespeare Globe Theater, which was located a few feet from where this one is.

We attended a wonderful version of Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night", which given that it was Gay Pride and the play had a Drag in the cast, made it all the more delightful.
