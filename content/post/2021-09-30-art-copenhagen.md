One of the advantages of living in Malmö is how easy is to travel by train to Copenhagen. So today I crossed the bridge to visit two museums there, since they're celebrating Art Week.

<!--more-->

It was a cold, windy and rainy day, so a typical day. Fortunately the train runs from city center to city center, and the A2 bus takes you from Copenhagen Central Station to almost my first destination: [Copenhagen Contemporary 'CC'](https://copenhagencontemporary.org/en/exhibitions/).

I enjoyed all of them very much:

* [Art of Sport](https://copenhagencontemporary.org/en/art-of-sport/) (I would inlcude [Elmgreen & Dragset 'Short Story'](https://copenhagencontemporary.org/en/elmgreen-dragset/) in that one)
* [København, kærlighed & candyfloss](https://copenhagencontemporary.org/en/copenhagen-love-candyfloss/)
* [Yoko Ono 'Wish Tree Garden'](https://copenhagencontemporary.org/en/yoko-ono-2/)

I enjoyed even more having THREE of my works exhibited at CC, but more about that in another post.

Then I took the bus again to go to Kunsthal Charlottenborg, mainly to see the amazing ['The World is in You' by The Medical Museion](https://kunsthalcharlottenborg.dk/en/exhibitions/the-world-is-in-you/), [although the posters collection on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Freetown Christiania, was also interesting](https://kunsthalcharlottenborg.dk/en/exhibitions/christiania-50-years/).

'The World is in You' blends science, contemporary art, and historical objects, exploring how our bodies are connected to the world in and around us. Even though I'm "in the industry" (tech/science/art) there were MANY objects, installations, and above all discoveries, that surprised me. This kind of "connect the dots" exhibition is my favorite, and when you think about the implications, it's truly transformative.

If I had more time, I would have also visited three more exhibitions: [Tomás Saraceno 'Event Horizon' at Cisterne](https://frederiksbergmuseerne.dk/en/udstillinger/tomas-saraceno-event-horizon/), ['Grønningen 2021' at Denfrie](https://denfrie.dk/en/exhibition/gronningen-4/), and [David Lynch 'Infinite Deep' at Nikolaj Kunsthal](http://www.nikolajkunsthal.dk/en/udstillinger/infinite-deep). I guess you can't have it all.
