I asked my daughter, where do you want to go to this weekend? She said San Francisco, so... there we went!

It doesn't take much to convince me to go on a trip. Particularly if my kids and or my wife come with me. This time it was just my daughter and me in San Francisco for the weekend.

We stayed at the [W](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/sfowh-w-san-francisco/overview/), visited the adjacent [San Francisco Museum of Modern Art](https://www.sfmoma.org/) (we found out entrance was complimentary to hotel guests too late, but I'm always happy to pay for art), the [North Beach Festival](https://www.sfnbba.org/north-beach-festival), Chinatown, the Golden Gate, Japantown, The Japanese Tea Garden, rode the Cable Car, Fisherman's Wharf... and had a lot of fun, while also witnessed the sad decay of the city.
