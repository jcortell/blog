PS: This morning I missed <a title="https://social.macys.com/parade2011" href="https://social.macys.com/parade2011" target="_blank">Macy`s Thanksgiving Parade</a> because I miscalculated the angle.  From my living room, the Empire State Building blocks the view, and from the sun deck (50th floor), being 2 streets to the East and 5 to the South made the viewing impossible. Next year, better to go to Central Park in the morning.
