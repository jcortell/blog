Wednesday, June 12, woken up by a false fire alarm, we had breakfast in the room, worked on our laptops until check out time, and had the hotel car (a BMW series 7) take us to the Vancouver Cruise Terminal. After a quick US immigration check, we boarded the luxury <a title="https://www.rssc.com/ships/seven_seas_navigator/ " href="https://www.rssc.com/ships/seven_seas_navigator/" target="_blank">Regent Cruises’ “Seven Seas Navigator”</a>.

Champagne glass upon reception, and a very nice crew welcomed us to our comfortable room. My travel agent (<a title="https://stephanieserinotravelblog.blogspot.com" href="https://stephanieserinotravelblog.blogspot.com" target="_blank">blog</a>, <a title="https://www.stephaniestravels.com" href="https://www.stephaniestravels.com" target="_blank">web site</a>, <a title="https://twitter.com/Cruise_Curator" href="https://twitter.com/Cruise_Curator" target="_blank">twitter</a>) was not exaggerating when she claim that their rooms feel like those on a Ritz Carlton hotel: ample walk-in closet, L’Occitane bathroom products, plush bathrobes and slippers, fresh fruit and flowers, huge and very comfortable bed, fully stocked complimentary mini-fridge, a bottle of champagne, turn down service with chocolate mint…

Right before sailing away, and after a quick buffet lunch with crab, prawns, steamed vegetable and rice, we underwent the required and mandatory emergency drill, after which we went on the deck to wave Vancouver good bye. I could not believe some kids were actually swimming in the outdoors pool! I am now completely convinced that those Canadians are made of insulating material: during this trip we have seen many Canadians wearing tank tops, t-shirts, shorts and flip-flops, while my New York fiancé and this poor Spaniard froze while wearing four and five layers of clothing.

Before showering and changing (no jeans or shorts allowed after 6pm on board this ship) we checked out the DVD selection, although there are 154 movies available in the in-room interactive TV, and got “The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus”. We also confirmed reservations (dinner and excursions) and then had a succulent dinner which included shrimp, local rockfish with vegetable-stuffed squid, pistachio supreme, and Vancouver butter cinnamon tart.

Entertainment on a ship this small is expectedly not excellent (unlike the star-studded Norwegian Breakaway with their 3 simultaneous Broadway shows), but that is OK because it more than makes for it in style, luxury, coziness, and amazing land excursions.
