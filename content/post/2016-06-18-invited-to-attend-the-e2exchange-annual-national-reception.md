On Thursday, I was invited to attend the E2Exchange Annual National Reception at Banking Hall (London)

It started as a fun networking evening event, where I met all kinds of people, from VCs, to the owner of a large bank, to PR specialistsâ€¦ even a hypnotherapist!

Some politicians, like The Secretary of State for Business, had confirmed their attendance and were scheduled to debate Brexit, but they cancelled at the last minute due to the terrible murder of Jo Cox.
