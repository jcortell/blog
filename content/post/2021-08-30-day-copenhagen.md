On Monday, August 30th, we decided to take a train from Malmö (Sweden) to Copenhagen (Denmark) and revisit that beautiful city.

<!--more-->

The train ride is short, a little bit over half an hour, extremely convenient from city center to city center, and affordable. The only annoyance is that even though both countries are in the Schengen no-border area, due to the pandemic and other unrelated events, they were checking the passports. But in any case it was way faster and easier than taking a plane.

While my wife and I had been to Copenhagen before, the kids had not. First we strolled around from the station to the Christianborg Palace (too bad the Tårnet restaurant was not open on Monday, because we would have loved to eat there), Nyhavn, and down Strøget pedestrian and shopping street back to the City Hall (Københavns Rådhus), and finally Tivoli Gardens.

[Tivoli](https://www.tivoli.dk/en/) was clearly the main objective for the little one. The park opened in 1843 and is the second-oldest operating amusement park in the world. While not as "thrill ride" packed as a Disney or Universal Studios theme park, it is adorable, varied, and with plenty to do and enjoy.

A very enjoyable day. My son and I will soon be back to visit some of their many museums and eat at Tårnet.
