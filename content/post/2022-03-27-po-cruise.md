For the next seven nights we've been invited to cruise the Po river in Italy on [Uniworld S.S. La Venezia](https://www.uniworld.com/us/river-cruise/italy/venice-and-the-gems-of-northern-italy/2022-venice-to-venice), calling at: Venice, Chioggia, Polesella-Ferrara, Porto Viro, Chioggia, Torcello-Mazzorbo-Burano, and back to Venice.

<!--more-->

The cruise is called "Venice & the Gems of Northern Italy".

![Itinerary](https://www.uniworld.com/dfsmedia/0abe5a49082f4fa787b315e25f74cead/5940-50033/options/keepaspectratio/map-2021-vgni)

This is how Uniworld describes the cruise:

_Uncover the enchanted beauty and breathtaking history of Venice and Northern Italy. Travel to romantic Venice and treat yourself to a private evening opening and lighting ceremony at St. Mark’s Basilica. Depart the enchanting “City of Water” to explore the waterfront shops, colorful facades and peaceful canals unique to Burano, Mazzorbo and Torcello. Farther south, discover Chioggia—a charming southern port loved by fishermen, artists and anyone looking for unique gifts or souvenirs. Enjoy additional shopping time in “bountiful” Bologna and medieval Padua, once home to Galileo and Copernicus. Each of these enchanting locales is yours to uncover on “Venice & the Gems of Northern Italy.”_

Regarding the ship:

_The River Countess underwent a complete design renovation in 2020, debuting as the S.S. La Venezia to bring guests an enhanced luxury experience inspired by Northern Italy. The redesign of the S.S. La Venezia drew influence from the fine Fortuny fabrics displayed prominently onboard. Murano glass, gilded accents and artistic etched elements pay homage to popular Venetian aesthetics of the early 20th century, creating an onboard atmosphere that is at once elegant and nostalgic._

Time to have fun!
