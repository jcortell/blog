In order to attend the Biotech and Tech Transfer trade-show [BioVaria](https://www.biovaria.org/biovaria/about-biovaria), and to meet a Japanese corporation in Herrsching, I traveled to Munich, Germany for three days.

<!--more-->

The [hotel](https://eden-hotel-wolff-munich.hotel-ds.com/en/) was not exactly amazing, but it was very conveniently located, as the trade-show took place at the [Sofitel](https://www.sofitel-munich.com/).

The truth is that the trade-show was too small for a delegation of three from my company (we were even sponsors of the event). So we were done going through the presentations, posters, booths, networking, and delicious food pretty quickly. That means I had time to visit several museums, like:

* [Pinakothek der Moderne](https://www.pinakothek-der-moderne.de/en/). Some [photos here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/TSFMuGJEyyb9Xzvv5).
* [Die Neue Sammlung](https://dnstdm.de/), where another one of my pieces was exhibited (more on that in another post). Some [photos here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/K3YrBfhJL2AtGAj9A).
* [Alte Pinakothek](https://www.pinakothek.de/en). Some [photos here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/VNUiEq9wUnG41Efu8).
* [Haus der Kunst](https://hausderkunst.de/en/), where another one of my pieces was exhibited (more on that in another post). Some [photos here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/8cSsn2wzJT5jzHrCA).
* [NS-Dokumentationszentrum](https://www.ns-dokuzentrum-muenchen.de/en/home/). Some [photos here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/VgZXBECUmfFpGW1G6).

My meeting in Herrsching went well, and I was pleasantly surprised about how pretty the town is, particularly around the Kurpark near the water Some [photos here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/6izJeNiVH4y3b48C9).

Some photos of the trip, other than the museums [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/UVUTLkXQH5LEGr9y8), including people surfing in the river!
