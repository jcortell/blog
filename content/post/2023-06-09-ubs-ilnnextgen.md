I was asked to organize two events for Swiss investment bank UBS in Harvard: the [*NextGen23* Young Successors Community Event – Scientific Innovation in Harvard](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stew2023) June 6-7, and the [*10th Industry Leaders Network*: Innovation in Healthcare](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/this2023) June 8-9.

UBS called it "A Remarkable Confluence of Visionary Minds".

The 10th edition of the UBS Industry Leader Network (ILN) conference held in June at Harvard University brought together an exceptional group of renowned industry leaders, entrepreneurs, and experts from a broad range of sectors including Healthcare, Life Sciences, Chemistry, Engineering, and Financial Services.

The annual event is exclusive to ILN members. Since I have been a member for half a decade, I was asked to organize it this time. The members came flying in from Singapore, UK, Switzerland, and USA.

The [speaker lineup](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/this2023/people) included two Harvard University professors, two Harvard University Innovation Laboratories senior advisors, six founder CEOs, two VCs, a postdoc researcher, and an undergraduate student. An amazing lineup of well know key opinion leaders like Dr. John Warner, co-founder of Green Chemistry; Prof. George Church, Robert Winthrop Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School; or Prof. David A. Weitz, Wallinckrodt Professor of Physics and of Applied Physics, and Core Faculty Member, Wyss Institute at Harvard University.

I gave a presentation on AI in Healthcare, and moderated a panel discussion on BioTech and HealthTech Trends, which included Jennifer Lum (Cofounder and Managing Partner at Biospring Partners and advisory board member at The Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School), Vishal Doshi (Chairman & CEO, AUM Biosciences), and Raminderpal Singh (CEO Incubate.bio). The panel discussion on Longevity featured Amol Sarva (Life Extension Ventures), Brennan Overhoff (Founder of Mansarover), and Michael Florea (Founder of Olden Labs), and was moderated by James Jack (Head Business Owners & Multigen, UBS Wealth Management).

There was a startup showcase on day two of the event, by Novaxs, Adaptilens, Alvus Health, Nix Biosensors. This year’s conference also included a dinner at the Harvard Faculty Club, a tour of Harvard Yard, and a tour of the Pagliuca Life Sciences Laboratory.

The NextGen23 event followed a similar structure, although wider in [scope](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stew2023/program).

It included [speakers](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stew2023/people) such as Paul Hayre, Executive Director of the Harvard Grid; Sam Weiss Evans, Trust in Science Senior Research Fellow, Program on Science, Technology and Society Research Fellow, Harvard Data Science Initiative; Bella del Hierro, Harvard Business School Healthcare Club President; plus 3 startup CEOs, 2 Harvard Professors, and 6 startup showcases (InGel Therapeutics, PatientFirst.AI, Rock Fix, PeriPeach, Halo Braid, and Basis.ai).
