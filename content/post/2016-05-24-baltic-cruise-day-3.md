We arrived in Tallinn, Estonia, at 08:00h. Before disembarking, we ordered a hearty breakfast in the suite, so we would have energy to walk all day. It was a delight having breakfast in the room while enjoying the view of St. Olav’s church from our balcony.

Right after breakfast we took the shuttle to go downtown (although it is so close that it was quite unnecessary). Tallinn is a small city, being Estonia the smallest of all Baltic states. So we walked all over.
  
Since I had scheduled a business meeting at noon near the airport, at the headquarters of an Estonian software company, we had time to explore the old city center before my meeting.

The shuttle dropped us off right next to the Kanuti park, and we walked through Vana-viru and the Viru Gates into the old town, which is listed as a Unesco World Heritage site. We walked along Viru to Raekoja Plats and marveled at the metal dragon water-draining gargoyles protruding from the Town Hall., and continued walking towards the citadel (Toompea). The 13th century Toompea Castle, which today serves as Estonia’s Parliament is surrounded by a fortified wall. Inside the wall, we passed by the St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral with its onion domes, and the cathedral of Sr. Mary the Virgin, on our way to the Patkuli viewing platform, from which you get an excellent view of the Old Town.

We walked back down into Pikk, where we saw the Holy Spirit Church, Kanut Guild Hall, the House of the Brotherhood of Black Heads, and St. Olav’s Church. Then, passing by Fat Margaret’s cannon tower, we exited the Old Town so I could get a taxi to go to my business meeting.

After my meeting, I returned to meet my wife at a central cafe, where I took advantage of an open wifi to have a long business teleconference with some customers in Dubai, after which we walked back to the ship, in time for our departure.

Tallin is an adorable city with medieval buildings, winding cobblestone streets, pointing spires and turreted towers, that is worth a visit.

Of course, we did not see everything there is to see (no one ever does). Next time we have to visit places like the Japanese Garden, the Kumu Art Museum, or the Kadriorg Palace and Museum.

Back on the ship, since we missed lunch-time (and unlike other cruises, this one does not have a 24/7 buffet), we went to the Observation Lounge, where we enjoyed tea time, with some delicious little sandwiches and cakes, and a very talented piano player delighting us with some tasteful easy listening jazz sprinkled with small blues improvs.

After taking a break in our suite for reading and writing, we went to dinner, and before going to bed we watched the movie “Dirty Rotten Scoundrels”.
