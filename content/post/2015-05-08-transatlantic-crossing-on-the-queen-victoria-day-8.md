Saturday, May 2, was our last day at sea. We got up late, but still on time to have breakfast at the Britannia restaurant. At 10 am we attended a very interesting lecture by Aldon Ferguson on Covert Operations in the Cold War. After yet another time change, we had lunch followed by an unexpected nap. 

We graciously avoided the Guest Talent Show, and went to the Library instead, to catch up on some work and return the books we had checked out.

Before heading to dinner, we packed and, as it is customary in cruises, we left the luggage outside the door to be picked up by the porters. Then we were invited by Cunard Lines to deluxe canap√©s and a bottle of Pol Acker brut Blanc de Blancs, with which we toasted farewell to this wonderful cruise.

Of course we went to dinner not hungry at all, as usual. But as usual dinner was so delicious that it did not matter whether we were hungry or not.

By the time we woke up the next morning we were already docked in Southampton, and our driver was waiting to take us and our luggage to our new apartment, next to the London Bridge.

Here we are, London!
