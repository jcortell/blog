December 2 I went to the <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern" target="_blank">Tate Modern</a> with the whole family, since my mother-in-law was visiting from overseas.

I really like how it is set up according to concepts, rather than chronologically, by artists, or by styles. It feels more like an art gallery (which it is) than a museum. It puts things into the subjective focus of the curator. I wonder how much the artists themselves would agree with the collection parameters, but it definitely is a welcome departure from the more traditional museum logic.

After all, if we are to accept the subjectivity inherent in an artist’s piece, why should we be afraid of taking it one step further and let the curator do a “double take” on that interpretation?
