After a very nice Thanksgiving with my wife`s family in Western New York, I flew directly to Chicago to spend the first week of December exhibiting alongside IBM and Avnet at a trade show called RSNA (Radiological Society of North America) with my friend and coworker Juan.Â 

Not only it was great for business, but we also saw some awesome technology (like 3D printing of organs), made friends, and had fun attending a couple parties.
