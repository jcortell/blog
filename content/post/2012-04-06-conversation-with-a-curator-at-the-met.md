This morning I have been at the <a title="https://www.metmuseum.org/" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/" target="_blank">MET</a>. First I took advantage of the invitation to preview the <a title="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2012/dawn-of-egyptian-art" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2012/dawn-of-egyptian-art" target="_blank">Dawn of Egyptian Art</a> exhibition which will be on display April 10–August 5, 2012.

While there were many remarkable pieces (for several reasons) in the exhibition, this coyote figure completely captivated me. The legs` position denote movement, which is uncommon in animal depictions of the later eras. The reason being that as art evolved, and became "institutionalized" in Ancient Egypt, it adhered more closely to standards and canons, loosing some if the earlier work`s creativity and freedom, such as this one.

Then, after a delightful lunch at the <a title="https://www.metmuseum.org/visit/plan-your-visit/dining-at-the-museum/members-dining-room" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/visit/plan-your-visit/dining-at-the-museum/members-dining-room" target="_blank">Member`s Dining Room</a> overlooking Central Park, I went to the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing, to the African Art collection, where I met museum curator Yaëlle Biro who explained some particular characteristics regarding the oily wood figures on display (and particularly the Madagascar Pole).
