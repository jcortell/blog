On the first day of our 9 night cruise around the Iberian Peninsula, we docked in Palamos.

<!--more-->

After breakfast we decided to take a leisurely stroll into town. The ship docks right next to downtown, as Palamos is a quaint little fishermen village located on the Costa Brava, known for its prawns.

We walked out of the port to the East, following an adorable wooden cliff-side path past the Marina, with beautiful and very Mediterranean views of the bay. We passed Cala del Morro de Vedell, Cala dels Pots, all the way to Cala Margarida. Then decided to head back through the town's main pedestrian street. Before heading back to the ship we walked along the promenade alongside the Platja Gran beach.

Once back onboard my wife worked a bit while I read, and then we got ready for the cocktail reception we were hosting for her customers in the Observation Lounge. After the reception, we selected Le Dame restaurant for dinner, all dressed up as the night's dress code was "formal".
