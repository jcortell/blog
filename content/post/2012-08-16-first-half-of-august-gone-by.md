Before more days go by and I forget the things I have been doing, here is a quick run-down for the first half of August (the last day of July I went to a Sigur Rós concert in Prospect Park):

August 1st I went to the MoMA to watch Hitchcock`s "To catch a thief" and eat at the nearby Le Pain Quotidien.

August 2nd, instead of taking advantage of the invitation to the Park Avenue Armory for the opening night party for Janet Cardiff & George Bures Miller: "The Murder of Crows", I went to AlphaOne Labs for a 3D printing session. But it turns out the session was cancelled, so ended up having dinner and a long conversation in Brooklyn.

August 4th I spent completely (and delightfully) at the MET.

  Augut 6th I went to the Social Security Administration to get a replacement card (needed for my ID and driver`s license). I took this picture of a stupid sign there. After that, I saw "The Adventures of Robin Hood" at Bryant Park.

  August 7th I was invited to a wonderful "M Ward + Yo La Tengo" concert at Prospect Park (thanks, it was great! unlike my crappy phone picture).

  August 8th I strolled through Grand Central and re-discovered the market (where I got some food and ate it at Bryant Park).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  August 9th I went to the MoMA <a title="https://cortell.net/blog/2012/08/with-keanu-reeves-and-chris-kenneally-at-side-by-side-premiere-moma/" href="https://cortell.net/blog/2012/08/with-keanu-reeves-and-chris-kenneally-at-side-by-side-premiere-moma/" target="_blank">premiere</a> of Keanu Reeves` new documentary about the film industry.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  August 11th I went to Times Square Summer Festival (just a couple of streets closed to the traffic, where I got some mozzarepa, crêpe, and lemonade).
</p>

<p style="text-align: left">
  August 12th I had an awesome day at two parks. First I went kayaking on the Hudson River (Riverside Park downtown boathouse). Then to Central Park where I reflected on the Imagine mosaic, enjoyed moving music under the Bethesda Terrace, and had a blast seeing the <a title="https://www.google.com/search?q=afrobats+new+york" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=afrobats+new+york" target="_blank">AfroBats</a> and the <a title="https://cpdsa.org/" href="https://cpdsa.org/" target="_blank">Central Park Roller Skaters</a>.
