On Tuesday we went to Valencia to enjoy a day of art exhibits.

First we went to the [MUVIM](https://www.muvim.es/) *(Valencian Museum of Illustration and Modernity* -sic-) to have lunch at their adorable terrace. 

Since the museum was closed at lunchtime, we decided to go to the [IVAM](https://www.ivam.es/en/) (*Valencian Institute of Modern Art*), where we spent the rest of the day enjoying some of the best exhibitions they've had for a while:

* [The Abstraction Eclosion](https://www.ivam.es/en/exposiciones/the-abstraction-eclosion-ivam-collection/)
* [Anzo. Isolation](https://www.ivam.es/en/exposiciones/anzo/). An amazingly contemporary and pleasant exhibition of a Valencian artist from the 60's.
* [Julio Gonzalez's Constellations](https://www.ivam.es/en/exposiciones/julio-gonzalezs-constellations/)
