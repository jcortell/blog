August 30th my wife and I acquired another work of art for our collection.

In this case we chose Colombian contemporary artist Carlos Motta: "Brief history of US Interventions in Latin America since 1946, 2005/14" (Guggenheim UBS MAP Purchase Fund 2014.39).

It is part of a series produced by Carlos Motta between 2005 and 2009 that present two chronologies of events in Latin America: one of U.S. interventions in the region since 1946, and one of the area`s leftist guerrilla movements. One side of the print outlines the interventions` interconnected narratives in text; the other depicts two bloody handprints and the symbol of the Mano Blanca death squads from the 1980s El Salvador.
