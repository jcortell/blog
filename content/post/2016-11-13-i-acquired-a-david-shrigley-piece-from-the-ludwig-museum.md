November 9 I acquired from the Ludwig Museum “I collect records”, a 27 cm ø 175gr. professional vinyl frisbee piece that the Turner Prize-nominated artist and occasional DJ David Shrigley created in 2012.

<span>“I collect records” is b</span>ased on a drawing he did for a record cover featured in his exhibition _Life and Life Drawing_.
