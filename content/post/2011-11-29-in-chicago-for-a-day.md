Back in Chicago for a day. Delayed flight out of NY JFK (air traffic), cloudy and windy in _Windy City_ (what`s new), work, work, work, and cancelled flight out of O`Hare due to...wind. Shit. Stuck in the airport most of the night, waiting for the next flight out.

At least I got a taste of the Tesla Roadster... only to discover it is too small for me!
