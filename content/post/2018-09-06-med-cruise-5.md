September 8th was our 7th day in our family Mediterranean cruise onboard the [Norwegian Epic](https://www.ncl.com/ca/en/cruises/7-day-western-mediterranean-from-barcelona-EPIC7BCNNAPCIVLIVCEQPMIBCN/schedule?&itineraryCode=EPIC7BCNNAPCIVLIVCEQPMIBCN&customerStoriesCurrentPage=1&customerStoriesPageSize=3), spending the day in Palma. The following day we disembarked in Barcelona.

We know Palma well, and we love it (although not as much as Ibiza, of course).

In short, a very pleasant week enjoying the slides, the performances (spectacular production of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, and also great circus dinner show), and above all, being with the family.
