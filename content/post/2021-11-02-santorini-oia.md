The fifth day of our cruise, we anchored in Thera (Thira - Θήρα in Greek) or Santorini, how it used to be known, and visited Oia, Pyrgos, and Firas.

Santorini is an Aegean island group with rugged terrain. Our excursion took us from Athinios port to Oia village. Oia has that postcard perfect blue & white architecture that everyone thinks of when picturing a Greek vacation. It might be impossible to live there how steep the streets on the cliff are, but it sure it's pretty.

Then we drove to Profitis Ilias monastery for mountaintop views of the islands, stopped for a quick mezze lunch at Pyrgos Kallistis, and drove to the capital Firas, with its winding streets, many stores, restaurants with ocean view, and two main ways of going up and down the mountain: cable-car or donkey.

Back at the ship we had dinner at Compass Rose, with its multiple combinations of courses, sauces, side dishes... fun!
