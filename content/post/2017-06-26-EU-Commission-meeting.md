Last Monday, June 19, I participated in the first meeting of the European Commission Expert Group on Venture Philanthropy and Social Investments.

The meeting itself was not particularly exciting, as it was the first one, and getting an expert group formed by 11 experts from 10 European countries coordinated is not an easy task. 

But the trip was filled with anecdotes, like having to wait in line for 15 minutes while 4 security personnel helped a single person check-in, being escorted to the wrong room upon arrival (they only noticed it after I had introduced myself to around 20 people and their session started on a completely unrelated issue), or being evacuated from the building (DG Research & Innovation - it ended up being a false alarm):

Yet another anecdote: the following day they found a terrorist with a bomb in the same Brussels train station I use to travel from and to London.
