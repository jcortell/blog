I can`t seem to be able to keep up. Too much going on at all levels. So my "done this and that" posts are going to be reduced to the minimum expression.

September 5th I went to <a title="https://cortell.net/blog/2012/09/round-table-at-nycba-about-campaign-reform/" href="https://cortell.net/blog/2012/09/round-table-at-nycba-about-campaign-reform/" target="_blank">this</a> event I already talked about.

September 7th I was invited to attend the premiere of a documentary about Gerhard Richter at the New Museum. It was very revealing and sad to see how Richter`s art critic/historian proposed an interpretation of one of his paintings that Richter did not seem to agree on, but after a few minutes of conversation, he "accepted". The system`s wheel`s will turn… and crush you in you get under them.

After that I had time to go to a party at the SoHo loft of NWC. I took a bottle of Calpico, that someone had the happy idea of mixing with vodka. There were boards to draw on, props to take silly pictures with (too bad I was alone, and too shy to ask anyone to take a picture of me with a Darth Vader mask… as if I needed one ;), a cotton candy machine that my ineptitude almost jammed, and of course an awesome DJ. Oh, yes, and people, lots of people.

  From the 10th until the 20th I was in Spain. I went to Valencia to visit my family and friends, and to Malaga for work. Here are some pictures. Particularly cool are the heart and DNA pattern (am I the only one seeing that there?) on my grandpa`s mosaic tile floor.

The 21st I went on an art walk around Williamsburg, presented by start-up artsnapper. Lots of people, great graffiti, and an interesting "art gallery extension in a truck".  
[Next week I will add some links]

The 22nd I visited the future: MakerBot`s first shop. Located in Mulberry Street, New York. It was awesome. Not only because of the 3D printers, and all that can be printed by them. But also because you can purchase 3D printed objects (from toys to watch straps) and plastic cords for the printers. Call me an incurable geek, but I got excited.

The 23rd I watched the <a title="https://cortell.net/blog/2012/09/searching-for-sugar-man/" href="https://cortell.net/blog/2012/09/searching-for-sugar-man/" target="_blank">movie</a> "Searching for Sugar Man".

The 24th I moved to my new offices in SoHo, and met with a singer who had been in several federal jails accused of espionage. NY is amazing.

I visited Dumbo Arts Festival on Saturday 29th, where I enjoyed a wonderful day.  
[Next week I will add some links]

Sunday 30th I hit a double home run: first the amazing World Maker Faire (a dream come true for makers of all ages and conditions)

</p>

and then the NY Art Book Fair at MoMA PS1, full of great art books and publishers, and more hipsters than I can take.

[Update: I forgot to mention I bought an original Steve Keene painting "Bomb Allen Ruppersberg" at MoMA PS1]

Of course, the Point5, graffiti, and vinyl galleries in the ‘hood are cool too.

Finally, here are some random pictures of NY I have taken in September.

And then I enter my life-changing October.
