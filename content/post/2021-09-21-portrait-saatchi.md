It's one thing to have your works [selected for sale at the Saatchi Gallery online](https://www.saatchiart.com/jorgecortell). It's a whole different thing to have your work exhibited at the Saatchi Gallery in London. That's what happened to me. Look'ma, "I'm an artist" now!

<!--more-->

I used to be a "my *art* is only for myself, I don't know if anyone else is interested, and I don't care". I even uploaded a ton of "future art projects" to Tumblr. Then, somehow, since being named Technology Adviser to the Saint Charles Royal Academy of Art (Spain) in 2015, I got more involved in "institutional art" than before. Wether curating from Spain to Lithuania, participating in performances, or exhibiting, I have done a few things with and in a few museums:

- June, 2016: Tate Modern, London (UK)
- October, 2016: Las Naves, Valencia (Spain)
- November 2016: Museum Ludwig, Cologne (Germany)
- December, 2016: National Museum of Fine Arts, Santiago (Chile)
- May, 2019: Moco Museum, Amsterdam (Netherlands)

But this is the first time that my work is featured in a Gallery, instead of a museum. And not just any Gallery.

[Saatchi Gallery](https://www.saatchigallery.com/), since 1985, has presented contemporary art exhibitions showcasing the work of emerging artists. Exhibitions which drew upon the collection of Charles Saatchi, led to Saatchi Gallery becoming a recognised authority in contemporary art globally. The Gallery acquired a strong reputation for introducing [artists who would later gain worldwide recognition](https://www.saatchigallery.com/about/35-years-of-art) like Cy Twombly, Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Sol Lewitt, Frank Stella, Dan Flavin, Anselm Kiefer, Richard Serra, Chuck Close, Philip Guston, Bruce Nauman, John Chamberlain, Lucian Freud, Cindy Sherman, Damien Hirst, Julian Schnabel, Sarah Lucas, Paula Rego, Richard Prince, Charles Ray, Andreas Gursky, ALex Katz... and so many more!

It has occupied different premises, first in North London, then the South Bank by the River Thames, and finally in Chelsea, its current location at the Duke of York's HQ, a 70,000-square-foot (6,500 m2) building on Kings Road, London, near Sloane Square.

Rebecca Wilson, the gallery's ex head of development, was quoted in [a piece by The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/dec/14/saatchi-revolution-continues-china-art) saying:

> The gallery's guiding principle is to show what is being made now, the most interesting artists of today. It's about drawing people's attentions to someone who might be tomorrow's Damien Hirst.

So you can probably understand my excitement when two of my recent digital works (*[RAR RA AR ART](https://www.saatchiart.com/art/New-Media-RAR-RA-AR-ART-Limited-Edition-of-69/781245/8709981/view)* self-portrait and *[looking-interested](https://www.saatchiart.com/art/New-Media-looking-interested-Limited-Edition-of-99/781245/8710188/view)* portrait) where exhibited in the room opposite to the stairs in the second floor, within the Reflective Collective exhibition.

I would like to thank [Artexplora and Frédéric Jousset](https://artexplora.org/en/who-are-we/) for this opportunity.

Note: If you're laughing at all this, look, I'm with you. But isn't art a lot of horsing around, joking, hacking, and having fun with message and perception? Well... there you have it!
