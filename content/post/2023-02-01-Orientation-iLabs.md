On Wednesday I attended a very nice Spring Semester Orientation at Harvard iLabs.

<!--more-->

It was a wonderful opportunity to meet friends, students, and share my experiences.

I'm proud to be part of the Harvard Innovation Labs (as Expert in Residence), and amazed at its [impact](https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/about/news/harvard-innovation-labs-2022-year-in-review/): since 2011 it has served more than 10,000 students, alumni, and faculty, who raised over $5B. In 2022: it supported over 1,000 Student Ventures at the iLab; launched Lab X GEO to support Alumni-Led Ventures; and Health and Life Science Ventures from the Pagliuca Harvard Life Lab raised more than $800 million and created hundreds of jobs!
