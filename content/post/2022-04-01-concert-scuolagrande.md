We were invited to a private closed-door concert of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons by [Interpreti Veneziani Orchestra](https://www.interpretiveneziani.com/en/) at the breathtaking [Scuola Grande di San Rocco](http://www.scuolagrandesanrocco.org/home/) in Venice.

April 1st we enjoyed sailing through the Grand Canal, and walking the streets of Venice, but without a doubt, the highlight of the day was the concert.

Scuola Grande di San Rocco is known as Tintoretto's Sixtine Chapel, for it has over 52 works by the famous painter. Other works present include paintings by Titian and Palma il Giovane. It's a very special place for a concert. As a matter of fact, in 1958 Stravinsky's Threni was premiered at the Scuola with the composer conducting.

Imagine walking up to the amazing Salone Maggiore, surrounded by all those impressive Tintorettos which you can enjoy at your leisure without crowds, and seeing a small stage and a few chairs, just for you. The performance was nice, but with a "frame" like that, anything would have sounded great. A truly magical experience.
