Last Thursday I met with executives from Dell in the Dell Solution Center in New York to explore potential collaborations between my company and Dell.

Funny how large companies have adopted this system of offices / "solution" centers to make presentations to clients spread across major cities in the world. With telecommuting gaining ground but face to face still being something fundamental in business, it makes much more sense than it seems.
