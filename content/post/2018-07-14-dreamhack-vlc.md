Saturday, July 14 we went to DreamHack Valencia, the eSports event. Family fun!

<!--more-->

My kids and I are totally into videogames, and my nephew is an eSports manager, so it's only natural that as a family event, we all went to [DreamHack](https://dreamhack.es/), since we were in Valencia (Spain).

For all of you who do not know about the amazing speed and momentum eSports are gaining, you should go to one of these events and realize why they have a bigger audience than the NFL Superbowl or the [US Presidential Inauguration](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paularmstrongtech/2017/03/16/46-million-watched-live-esports-event-10-million-more-than-trump-inauguration-broadcast/#589c16e891f4). [Over 100 million people](https://esc.watch/blog/post/100M-viewers-esports).
