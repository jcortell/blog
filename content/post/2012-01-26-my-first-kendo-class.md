My shoulders and back still hurt, but it was previsible: one hour of Kendo with Ilaria Montagnani (Nike endorsed athlete, and one of the topÂ trainersÂ in NY according to the Wall Street Journal or New York Magazine), and you will not ever wonder how she got all those muscles in her body.

For some odd reason, Kendo feels natural to me. And I say odd, because I am usually lacking the required coordination andÂ flexibilityÂ for almost any sport. But even holding the bokken feels right (as opposed to the racquet or bat, which make my hands develop blisters in a few minutes).

I know, in a previous life (if I only believed in that) I was a little samurai roaming the hills of Japan ðŸ™‚

One thing is for sure: when I move to Japan, I will learn Iaido (and also practice Aikido again). Someday.
