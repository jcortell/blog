I have been invited to participate as a special guest in a UBS' live webinar about investments in 2021.

<!--more-->

UBS Switzerland AG has organized the [webinar *CIO Year Ahead 2021 "The Next Big Thing"*](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/chief-investment-office/market-insights/2020/live-stream-update.html) for Thursday, January 21st at 16:30 -17:30 CET, in which Rolf Ganter, Head European Equities, UBS Global Wealth Management, will explain why they call 2021 "A Year of Renewal" and where they see long-term investment opportunities in the decade of transformation ahead.

I have been invited to participate as a special guest to "share best practice examples of navigating the pandemic, and explain how it will change the future of the Healthtech sector".
