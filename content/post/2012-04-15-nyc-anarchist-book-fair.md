Since I could not get a hold of tickts for New Museum`s <a title="https://rhizome.org/sevenonseven/" href="https://rhizome.org/sevenonseven/" target="_blank">Seven on Seven</a>, I decided to make the most out of my day yesterday (defying my cold), so I even had time to visit the <a title="https://www.anarchistbookfair.net/" href="https://www.anarchistbookfair.net/" target="_blank">NYC anarchist book fair</a>, at Judson Church (Washington Square).

I wish I had had more time to devote to exploring all the literature (great and aweful) on display. But at least I had time to notice:

  * How little people attending knew about anarchy (imagine those outside)
  * How deliciously ironic that it took place in what used to be a church
  * How much anarchy is related to art (indeed, as a matter of fact, one of the books I purchased was <a title="https://naasn.org/" href="https://naasn.org/" target="_blank">NAASN</a>â€˜s "<a title="https://anarchist-developments.org/index.php/adcs/issue/current" href="https://anarchist-developments.org/index.php/adcs/issue/current" target="_blank">Anarchist Developments in Cultural Studies</a> 2.2011)
