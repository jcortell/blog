For a number of reasons,I had to drive to New York City twice in two weeks.

<!--more-->

The first trip was March 10-12th. We stayed at the [Intercontinental NY Times Square](https://www.interconny.com/). A little subpar compared to other Intercontinental hotels, but very conveniently located. The view from the room was hard to beat, but we did find a much better view the following day.

On Friday we met a friend for dinner at [Cafe Un Deux Trois](https://www.cafeundeuxtrois.com/) in the heart of Broadway. 

The next day we inspected the new and amazing [Ritz Carlton New York NoMad](https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/new-york/nomad#Hotel). They really did a wonderful job with the interior decoration! And the views... simply stunning. After the inspection, we had lunch with another friend at the hotel's [Zaytinya](https://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/new-york/nomad/dining/zaytinya), the Mediterranean fusion restaurant by José Andrés. For dinner we went to one of our classic favourites, the mid-twon underground Japanese restaurant and sake oasis [Sakagura](http://www.sakagura.com/). We did not care much for the Middle Eastern touches in their classical Japanese menu, but it was still worth it.

On Sunday, while my wife had a ship inspection in NJ, my daughter and I had lunch at the Roman cuisine restaurant [Amarone Scarlatto](https://scarlattony.com/), in the Theater District. Then we drove back to Boston.

A few days later, on Thursday the 23rd, I had to return to NYC. This time to meet the New York University Langone Health technology transfer team, at their One Park office. That brought back a lot of memories, since I used to go to the [Equinox](https://www.equinox.com/clubs/new-york/midtown/park) gym around the corner when I lived in E29th street, between 5th Avenue and Madison Avenue.
