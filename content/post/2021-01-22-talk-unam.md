My friend, philosopher, author, and professor [Vico](https://vico.mx/), interviewed me for [Mexico's Autonomous National University (UNAM)](https://www.unam.mx/) [TV program "Abre tu micro"](https://tv.unam.mx/?s=abre+tu+micro) about AI in Healthcare.

I've known Vico for years, since he was teaching at the University of Seville, and invited me to speak in a couple of conferences there. You should really check out his book "[Filosof√≠a para desconfiados](https://www.todostuslibros.com/libros/filosofia-para-desconfiados_978-607-07-5862-1)".
