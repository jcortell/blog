This weekend we had some spare time, so we decided to visit New York City because we miss it and because... who needs a reason to visit NYC?

<!--more-->

It has been years since my wife and I met, married, and lived in the city, so we decided to bring the little one to the city again, and just do the tourist thing: stay at a [hotel](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/nycri-residence-inn-new-york-manhattan-times-square/overview/) by Times Square, go to the [Top of the Rock at Rockefeller Center](https://www.rockefellercenter.com/attractions/top-of-the-rock-observation-deck/), Brooklyn Bridge, meet a friend, have some [Greek lunch](https://kellariny.com/), [Cuban dinner](https://www.havanany.com/), [Lady M Green Tea Mille CrÃªpes](https://www.ladym.com/items/lg-green-tea-mille-crepes), visit an [outlet mall](https://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlet/woodbury-common)...
