On Wednesday we went to the "<a title="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/News-Events-Public-Programs/Calendar/Detail?id=15684" href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/News-Events-Public-Programs/Calendar/Detail?id=15684" target="_blank">Tribute to Elliott Carter</a>" concert at City University of New York Graduate Center (34th st & 5th Ave). A varied roster of (mostly) great (mostly) young performers, and Elliott Carter`s unmistakable`s compositions. I must admit it is not my favorite kind of music to say the least, but I do keep trying to expand my horizons. Always learning, or trying to. Experience, expose, try... isn`t that the hacker`s attitude?

But we had to leave the concert during the intermission in order to make it to the New Museum`s cocktail party and opening night for "<a title="https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/nyc-1993-experimental-jet-set-trash-and-no-star" href="https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/nyc-1993-experimental-jet-set-trash-and-no-star" target="_blank">NYC 1993: Experimental jet set, trash and no star</a>". 

As it is so often the case with The New Museum, the exhibition had terrible things and a couple of very interesting pieces. But upon further thought, it makes perfect sense: we are talking contemporary art here. 1993. Twenty years (yes, I`m sure we all thought, at some point or another, when watching the exhibition "times flies, I remember when...") is not enough of a perspective to discern.

> We are in the middle of it. And that, in itself, makes it wonderfully fun if not brainy deep – no matter how much the curator tries to make it look so in the silly information label/tag next to the works.

The evening ended with a delightful "sampler" dinner at the <a title="https://www.firmdalehotels.com/new-york/crosby-street-hotel/crosby-street-bar" href="https://www.firmdalehotels.com/new-york/crosby-street-hotel/crosby-street-bar" target="_blank">Crosby Hotel Bar and Terrace</a>.
