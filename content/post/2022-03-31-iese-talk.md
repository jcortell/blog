IESE is a Spanish private university that has been leading the world's best business school [rankings](https://www.iese.edu/rankings/) for years. I was honored to be invited as a panelist during their annual event Healthcare Days.

[Here](https://fiorp.org/evento/iese-2022-life-changing-future/) is the full program of the day.

Since I was in Italy, I participated via videoconference in Panel 2: New Business Model in Healthcare Ecosystem, along with Jorge Pou (Astra Zeneca), Fernando Puente (ZS), and Stefano Zagnoni (Janssen - J&J).
