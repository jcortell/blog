The last week of July and first two weeks of August my wife and IÂ were in Valencia with the kids. What a wonderful summer!

Seeing my son brave the waves to slide into the Mediterranean sea from a high boat slide, my daughter ride her horse into the sunset, or enjoying movies on a big screen in our terrace overlooking the sea and the city, were memories that I will cherish forever. Thank you for all the love <3
