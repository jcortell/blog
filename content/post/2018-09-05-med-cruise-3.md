September 5th and 6th were our 4th and 5th days in our family Mediterranean cruise onboard the [Norwegian Epic](https://www.ncl.com/ca/en/cruises/7-day-western-mediterranean-from-barcelona-EPIC7BCNNAPCIVLIVCEQPMIBCN/schedule?&itineraryCode=EPIC7BCNNAPCIVLIVCEQPMIBCN&customerStoriesCurrentPage=1&customerStoriesPageSize=3), spending one day in Rome (Civitavecchia), and the next one in Pisa (Livorno).

The truth is that I spent the whole Civitavecchia day in bed, trying to recuperate from the flu. American cruise lines tend to pump up the air conditioning, so taking one of their cruises in the summer, in a warm climate, is also guaranteed to get you sick.

Fortunately the next day I felt better, so I accompanied the family on an excursion to Pisa.
