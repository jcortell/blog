A day in Burano and attending a masquerade party.

<!--more-->

Burano is a quaint little island in Venice. It's easily recognizable because its houses are painted in different colors. It has become such an identity that homeowners require the town's council approval to paint their houses!

After a short stroll through town, we attended the highlight of the day: a masquerade party. By the way, yes, in the picture it's me, my wonderful wife Stephanie, and our friend Bob. That Bob ;-)
