      <description>It has been a while since I wrote a tutorial to Share The Wealth, so it’s about time I shared some practical (if basic) knowledge beyond reposting a link.
For years I have had a pet project in the backburner: I wanted to create presentations without the need of dedicated software, commercial (like PowerPoint or Keynote), or free (like LibreOffice or OpenOffice). That way I could avoid bringing my computer to a lecture, and not worry about what computer system would be available in the auditorium.</description>

      <title>A little over 24 hours in Peru</title>

      <description>On Sunday I left London to go to Peru for a business trip. I was connecting in Madrid but, due to a 4-hour delay in the departure of the flight, I missed my red-eye connection to Lima.
Fortunately, European Union regulations mandate that airlines feed and provide shelter to stranded passengers (subject to some conditions), unlike in the USA, where the same unfortunate circumstance is usually the passengers’ problem. So Iberia gave me a voucher for a dinner, a breakfast, a hotel night in a nearby hotel, two phone calls and the transfer to and from the hotel.</description>

      <description>The last day we felt a little sad knowing that we had to leave such a wonderful place. But we decided to make the most of it.
First, we made a quick trip to S’Aigua Blanca and Cala Llenya. Then we headed back to Portinatx.
Unfortunately, most charter boats only operate May-October, so my plan to sail around the island was thwarted. But, luckily, the very kind owner of a local grocery store in Portinatx told me I could borrow her paddle-board anytime.</description>

      <description>April 15 we went to my favorite part of the island, the South West, to visit all the little Calas I used to enjoy as a kid.
First Cala Bassa, where I remembered every corner, every water hole, every micro-cave… it’s mostly the same, including the little lizards (“lagartijas”) with the addition of a fancy beach club and some lounge chairs and cabanas. What a joy to be back!
Although the air temperature was great, the water temperature was quite cold (around 17º).</description>

      <description>April 14 we had an early breakfast and hit the road by car, although the best way to experience the many out of the way little beaches (or “Calas”) in the island is by bicycle or scooter, as you can access some quite secluded coastal gems.First we went to Cala Xuclàr, where the kids climbed like goats all over the
First, we went to Cala Xuclàr, where the kids climbed like goats all over the rocks and marveled at the old wooden structures fishermen built to protect their boats.</description>

      <description>After my daughter’s first concert, April 13-16 we took a little family vacation and went to the Mediterranean island of Ibiza.
Ibiza has a very special place in my heart. As a kid, I spent many summers enjoying “my own private little beach” in paradise, before there were any jet-setters, dance clubs, or large yachts on the island. There were only hippies and fishermen. It was heaven.
So I decided it was about time to take my American wife and two kids to the island.</description>

      <description>Tuesday, March 28 I took a nice flight from London to Santiago de Chile. Nice not because the constant turbulence, which made it feel like I was flying in a food mixer with wings, but because laying down completely stretched, I slept almost throughout the entire flight. The fact that the cabin crew were unusually nice also helped.
After a quick meeting in Santiago de Chile, I took another flight, this time to Asuncion (Paraguay), where I stayed until Sunday, April 2nd.</description>

      <description>After having breakfast on the deck, with views of the impressive cloud-brushing Hong Kong skyline, we disembarked one last time from our cruise ship, and took a taxi to the Airport Express Kowloon train station to check-in (including luggage) for our midnight flight, and leave carry-ons in storage. A very organized and civilized way to travel.
Then we took a taxi to the ferry terminal, and the Star Ferry to cross to the other side (Hong Kong Island) so we could take buses to visit different areas of Hong Kong:</description>

      <description>March 19 marked the last port of call in our trip.
We arrived at 16:00h, but had to wait until 17:00h to disembark because immigration authorities required ALL passengers to go through a face-to-face check, and a couple was missing (they found them an hour later).
We were docked at Harbour City Ocean Terminal in Kowloon, so as soon as we disembarked, we walked through the massive shopping mall, and then onto the streets of Hong Kong in Kowloon side.</description>

      <description>Saturday, March 18 the cruise was nearing its end as we sailed into China.
Before disembarking, we took a galley tour. It’s always fascinating to see what an extremely efficient machine a large cruise ship’s galley has to be in order to prepare and serve (on time and at the right temperature) thousands of dishes each day.
Upon disembarkation, a driver was sent to pick us up and take us to our destination, driving through Sanya:</description>

      <description>Friday, March 17 we arrived in Chan May Port, where we were picked up by a driver and a guide, who drove us to Hoi An, passing through Da Nang, the American Air Force Hangars from the “Second Indochina War” (or “Vietnam War”, or “American War”), Dragon Bridge, Marble Mountain, China Beach, and Monkey Mountain.
While Da Nang might be better known (and closer to Chan May’s port), we decided to take a bicycle ride around Cam Thanh (small village suburb of Hoi An), through Hai Ba Trung, next to the rice paddies and the Japanese Tomb, to the Water Coconut Palms to ride the round boats:</description>

      <description>Thursday, March 16, was a day at sea. I spent most of it working (blessed be laptops and satellite internet connection), reading (Scientific American, The Economist, The London Review of Books, etc) and resting, trying to get rid of the fever I caught in Saigon. I must have been really sick when I did not even feel like taking a single picture! 🙂
But we also attended a cooking demonstration (involving liquid nitrogen) by Guest Chef Steven Chou, and a couple of lectures, one by Tim Wade on “Chan May and Sanya” and another one by Prof.</description>

      <description>The following day, Wednesday, March 15, still in Saigon, we decided to “do Saigon like a Vietnamese”, and took a Saigon tour by Vespa:
The first stop was the Bird Lover Club at Tao Dan Park, where a group of bird owners bring the elaborate bamboo cages to the park in the morning, and hang them in hooks for the birds to sing. There’s even a small Insect Market nearby, so the birds can get “fresh treats”.</description>

      <description>Tuesday, March 14, upon disembarking near Saigon we were greeted by our driver and our guide, who drove us into town.
This time our guide was not so sweet. He was quite professional, but after a while and some conversation you could see the influence of wild capitalism and Chinese imperialism, in subtlety aggressive attitudes and misogynistic comments.
On the way he told us about the history of the country, the French occupation, and the War (they call it the American War, Americans and Europeans call it the Vietnam War, and officially it is the Second Indochina War).</description>

      <description>Monday, March 13, was a day at sea. We had breakfast in bed, and then attended three lectures.
The first one was by speaker and “local resident” (he used to live in Singapore and now lives in Hong Kong) Tim Wade on “Ho Chi Minh City” (very brief History of Vietnam).
The second one, and much more interesting and in depth, by Bob Donaldson (former US State Department Advisor, former President of Tulsa University and Fairleigh Dickinson University, and Political Science and Foreign Relations Professor and Administrator at Vanderbilt University and City University of New York) titled “Global Threats in the Twenty-first Century – Part I: How Did We Get to This Place in History, and Why Does It Seem So Dangerous Here?</description>

      <description>Sunday, March 12, we arrived in Sihanoukville (Cambodia). We were greeted by our driver, “Mr. Temple” and our guide, “Mr. Lucky”.
Mr. Lucky was a sweet guy who told us a great deal about Cambodia’s history, present, and his life. The kind of guide you always hope to get, but seldom do.
Mr. Lucky was the youngest of 4 brothers. His other 3 brothers died during the Khmer Rouge regime. Fortunately he survived (hence his nickname).</description>

      <description>Saturday, March 11, we docked in Laem Chabang Port, where we met our driver and our guide, who took us (my wife, me and two other couples) to Bangkok in a very “modded” luxury van, with so many buttons, levers, lights and switches that it was fun to imagine what each of them could be for: smoke screen? projectiles? disco ball? retractable wings? 😛
There are many visual elements that spring to mind when one thinks of Bangkok: Tuk Tuks, bubble gum pink taxis, crowded streets, trucks with all kinds of colored lights decorating inside and out… and we saw them all, all over.</description>

After taking a tender ashore, my wife and I we were picked and driven to the Belmond Napasai resort.
We had an absolute blast inspecting that property, and having a lot of fun on that most wonderful beach: kayak, snorkeling, paddle board, swimming, amazing local cuisine&amp;hellip;
Back onboard, we attended a lecture by Denise Heywood on Cambodia’s history, traditional dance, and Angkor Wat.</description>

      <description>Day at sea (Thursday, March 9):
The Crystal Symphony is a 781 feet (238 m) long by 100 feet (30 meter) wide cruise ship that weights over 51,000 tons, cruises at 20 knots, and has a guest capacity of 922, with a per guest staff ratio of 0.59 (crew of 545, from 45 different countries).
On this particular cruise, there were passengers from 49 different nationalities, but the large majority of them (over 600) were from the USA.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday, March 8, after having breakfast onboard the ship, we ventured into Singapore for one last afternoon. We had two things in our list:
Singapore Botanic Gardens(SGB)
Established in 1859, SGB is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the leading botanic gardens in the world (with over 4 million visitors every year). We only had time to throughly visit the National Orchid Garden (with 1000 species and 2000 hybrids, the largest display of orchids in the world), which is the only part of the SBG that charges a small cover charge fee, but the Botanic Gardens have many interesting areas to enjoy, like the Rain Forest, Swan and Symphony and Eco lakes, Herbs &amp;amp; Spices, Bougainvilleas &amp;amp; Bamboo Collection, Healing Garden, Fragrant Garden, Evolution Garden, Foliage Garden, etc.</description>

      <description>Tuesday, March 7 in the morning, after breakfast, we checked out of the hotel. But before we boarded the cruise ship, we left the luggage with the hotel’s concierge, and went across the bridge to visit the National Gallery Singapore, which is the only main museum in Singapore I had not yet visited, since it opened in 2015.
It has an interesting Asian art collection, with artist from the late XIX Century like Raden Saleh, to the XX Century like Liu Kang, Nguyen Gia Tri, and contemporaries like Tang Da Wu or Montien Boonma (whose “The Pleasure of Being, Crying, Dying and Eating” was being restored, and it looked better in the glass temporary encaging than when originally created in 1993, and reconstructed in 2015).</description>

After that, we walked into the city to visit Chinatown, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, and had an amazing &amp;ldquo;street-hawk&amp;rdquo; lunch at Lau Pa Sat food center:
In the evening we went to the Gardens by the Bay, visiting the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, and exiting just as the Supertrees were doing their mesmerizing solar-powered light and music show:</description>

When we arrived we received the VIP treatment at the iconic, and absolutely perfectly situated, Fullerton Hotel: we were greeted by our names curbside right off the taxi by a lovely lady that walked us directly into our room, without the need to stop at a reception desk or fill out any paperwork!</description>

In a series of forthcoming blog posts I will make a quick review of activities, places, and photographs.</description>

I had recently renewed my passport and ESTA, so I should be able to enter the USA without a problem right?</description>

Microsoft had invited me to participate in the ‘Health Digital Transformation at the Microsoft Executive Briefing Center, because my company is a founding member of the ‘AI in Health Partner Alliance (along with Microsoft and 20 other tech companies) which was launched at the event.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I went with my wife and son to visit the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert`s Museum exhibition You Say You Want a Revolution? Records and Rebels 1966-1970. The aim of the exhibition was quite clear:
 How have the finished and unfinished revolutions of the late 1960s changed the way we live today and think about the future?
 I was very much looking forward to visiting the exhibition. It is SO timely, and SO needed, I thought.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I took a stroll through Wimbledon Commons with my son, as my wife was traveling.It was a typical London day: 3 seasons in a day. When we decided to leave the apartment it was sunny and felt kind of warm. When we arrived at the forest, it was gloomy and chilly. And by the time we made it back home, it was already night time and really cold.</description>

      <description>The exhibition titled “Le Corbusier and South America”, in the main hall of the Contemporary Art Museum in Santiago (Chile), shows for the first time in Chile a collection of Le Corbusier’s original plans and drawings for 12 projects he created in South America (although, of all of those, only the Curutchet house in Argentina was actually built).
As part of the exhibition, Chilean curator Maximiano Atria has arranged all around the central part of the hall location-specific installations by a number of artists.</description>

      <description>Tuesday 13 I had the rare opportunity of spending a few hours doing what I like most during a business trip: visiting art museums. I went to the Fine Arts National Museum, the Contemporary Art Museum, the Visual Arts Museum, and the Telefonica Foundation Art Gallery.
Without a doubt, the two museums I enjoyed the most were the Fine Arts National Museum, and the Contemporary Art Museum.
The installation in the lobby of the Fine Arts National Museum is amazing, and the building itself (with a dome designed by Eiffel) is quite impressive.</description>

      <description>This week I have spent 5 days in Santiago de Chile.
A bad coordination with my partners IBM and the customer forced me to change my tickets 3 times. The problem is that with each time we approached the Christmas vacation and therefore flight availability decreased considerably. So in the end I had to fly via Toronto, and stay a day longer than it would have normally been necessary. But you can’t always (ever?</description>

      <description>For reasons beyond the scope of this post I was invited to participate in the UK-China Hi! Technology event in London.
The event was well attended by a large number of entrepreneurs, funds and investors from the UK and China.
The highlight of the event, for me, other than a couple of really interesting contacts, was to see all these suited-up people lining up to try the VR sets (HTC, Oculus, Hololens, etc).</description>

      <description>Most people I know would not consider protein structure analysis of mutations causing inheritable diseases &amp;ldquo;spare time fun&amp;rdquo;. Then again, most people I know don`t think I am like most people they know.
This week I`m a &amp;ldquo;single-dad&amp;rdquo;, since my wife is traveling. So my spare time right now is almost non existent. Nevertheless, the thought of mutating a Proline into a Glycine at position 22 intrigued me, so I spent a few minutes simulating it.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I visited the Design Museum(&amp;ldquo;The world`s leading museum devoted to contemporary design in every form from architecture and fashion to graphics, product and industrial design&amp;rdquo;) in its spectacular new location on High Street Kensington (London), with my son.
The #newdesignmuseum opened its doors in its new location only 5 days ago. The building and renovation are great, and in a nice location: on the edge of Holland Park, with the added bonus of being near the Kyoto Garden, Muji, and not far from the Serpentine Gallery.</description>

      <description>Adam Gilfix, Brian de Luna, and Luke Heine, with the help of Dealroom.co, have created a very interesting data visualization tool for Venture Capital (VC) flows.
I know for a fact and from experience that VC activity in places like Silicon Valley, NY, Boston, or London is big. But even when I go back home (Valencia – Spain) for the holidays, there are all kinds of &amp;ldquo;VC&amp;rdquo; events, news, meetings, spaces&amp;hellip; which, given the conservative and provincial nature of the &amp;ldquo;Valencian Investors&amp;rdquo; I have met, surprises me.</description>

Regardless of the very interesting business projects and meetings at the highest level ( in a single day I met with three &amp;ldquo;Secretaries&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Ministers&amp;rdquo;: Industry and Commerce, Technology, and Health), it was a pleasure to know one of the few countries that I had yet to visit in South America. Now I only have Bolivia left.</description>

The event run for 3 days, November 16-18, with 3 parallel tracks, and it included over 200 speakers. I spoke November 18, in the main auditorium.
There was an exhibition area, with several companies and organizations showing their innovations and technologies.</description>

      <description>Last week I spent 3 days in Düsseldorf, attending the Medica trade show. But I do not want to bore you with that. I`d rather tell you what I did after the trade show closed every day.
Since Düsseldorf is a city that I know well, I decided to concentrate in its museums and art galleries. I could not have picked a more perfect time!
At the Kunsthalle I attended the excellent exhibition titled “Wool and water”, wi­th: Li­li Du­jou­rie, Isa Genz­ken, As­trid Klein, Mi­scha Ku­ball, Aron Meh­zi­on, Rein­hard Mu­cha, Stur­te­vant, Ro­se­ma­rie Tro­ckel, and Ger­hard Rich­ter; cu­ra­ted by Gre­gor Jan­sen.</description>

Beyond the cute venue, and spectacular list of attendees from the healthcare, industry, and political spaces (“Don’t waste time talking to someone with ‘Lord’ in his title, they are not there to really work”, one of my colleagues advises me), what impressed me was the extremely well organized, choreographed, and disciplined approach to innovation they had.</description>

“I collect records” is based on a drawing he did for a record cover featured in his exhibition Life and Life Drawing.</description>

 The hotel was right next to the train station and the Cathedral, quite convenient It rained every frigging day. It was cold and dark Where there are trees, Autumn is quite a spectacle Rheinpark is very nice, but has too many walls.</description>

      <description>The other day I received a letter from Buckingham Palace, inviting me to have dinner with the Duke of York (Prince Andrew) on Thursday at Windsor Castle.
I was curious to see the castle from the inside: it is a medieval style fortress, filled with military memorabilia (guns, swords, lances, armors…), banners and crests. It was more Game of Thrones than Harry Potter.
The reception was held at the Grand Reception Room.</description>

      <description>Halloween has arrived in Wimbledon. The multicolored leaves paint their annual natural mosaic, one of the many subjective manifestations where we can observe our mind at work, interpreting events. Do you get taken away by the beauty of the color range? Does it make you wonder why everybody finds beautiful a cyclical natural event that occurs because tree leaves die, fall and rot? Do you associate it with annoyingly unpredictable weather and uncomfortably falling temperatures?</description>

      <description>November 1 I attended Future Decoded, the annual event where Microsoft and Partners present their forward looking products and concepts.
Besides some cool “event attractions” (like the Back To The Future Delorean, seeing how data is not completely deleted even if you deep freeze a hard drive, the Bloodhound record-breaking car, or seeing the inside of a Rolls Royce plane turbine), the key for me was to be able to demonstrate my company’s software running on an amazing 84” Microsoft Surface Hub, and attending the invitation-only Microsoft Executive Party at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel.</description>

By the end of September I had to attend a few events, like being invited to a member of Microsoft`s Partner Advisory Council (we held the first meeting at the InterContinental London Park Lane Hotel), or an E2E networking dinner at Charlotte Street Hotel:
Tuesday October 4 I travelled to Paris to meet a South American Vice-minister of Health in IBM France:</description>

He was very interested in talking about my company (Kanteron Systems), as we have developed technology that can really help some of his investments in Precision Medicine and Longevity.
Even more interesting than talking about investments, it was to know a little bit the man behind the legend.</description>

      <description>Saturday, October 8th, I attended day 1 of the Singularity University Exponential Medicine Conference in San Diegoat the amazing Hotel Del Coronado.
The event was organized mainly by Will Weisman and the incomparable Daniel Kraft, MD (whom I met last year at the London Stock Exchange), both from Singularity University.
The Conference was fully packed with activities. Morning activities started at 7am and included Yoga, Meditation, Art, and Beach Run. Evening activities changed every day, and included things like Team Collaboration &amp;amp; Innovation Games, Gadget &amp;amp; S’mores Bar, Music &amp;amp; Magic at the Bar, UnConference, or Silent Disco.</description>

      <description>Saturday, September 17, was my last day in San Francisco, and the only one I had with some spare time.
After breakfast, I went to but some gifts from Japan Town and then headed to Union Square, for the Korean Day (Chuseok) culture festival.
Then I went to the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts to check out Tom Sachs _Space Program: Europa_. As I feared, after the failure of _Sony Outsider,_ Tom Sachs obsession with demonstrating his hand-made &amp;ldquo;bricolage style&amp;rdquo; continues.</description>

      <description>Friday, September 16, I attended 3 &amp;ldquo;bilateral meetings&amp;rdquo;.The first one took place in downtown San Francisco, in Uber HQ.
The first one took place in downtown San Francisco, in Uber, which is in the same building as Square and across the street from Twitter.
That same morning there was a big story about how much money Uber is losing, and how artificially high their valuation is, but of course, nobody wanted to talk about that.</description>

      <description>Thursday, September 15 I had several meetings in Silicon Valley.
The first one was with the Director of Strategic Investments at the Microsoft Technology Center in Mountain View. Since it is business related, I won`t comment anything about that very interesting meeting.
The second one was with a Partner at Google Ventures. The discussion was to the point and provocative. It is interesting to note that Google and Google Ventures are NOT the same company.</description>

      <description>Wednesday, September 14 I spent the whole day at K&amp;amp;L Gates, one of the largest law firms in the world, which has customers like Microsoft (the “Gates” in K&amp;amp;L Gates is for Bill Gates’ father), Amazon, etc.
It was a typical upscale law firm setup: expensive video conference equipment and giant screens (I liked their “rear projector and mirror” trick) in a high-rise building with impressive views, and some art, like the “flying dildos” in reception.</description>

      <description>On September 13, Mind the Bridge hosted a policy hackathon sponsored by Dell at the MTB Innovation Center in San Francisco. The Dell PolicyHack™ brought together entrepreneurs and U.S./EU policy experts to solve policy challenges. The goal is to productively brainstorm and to provide top-line thinking that can inspire and serve as basis to develop and implement full policies.
My team was formed by:
 Sara R. Klucking (Section Chief, Innovation &amp;amp; Programs, Office of Science and Technology Cooperation, US Department of State) Bogdan Ceobanu (Policy Officer, Startups &amp;amp; Innovation, European Commission) David Hodgson (CEO, Hummingbird Labs) me  The five teams had 75 minutes to come up with a policy solution to issue areas that impact entrepreneurs.</description>

      <description>Tuesday September 13 was a day devoted to workshops, a policy hackathon, and a visit to Pinterest HQ.
As I have mentioned before, we have been fortunate to have a great group of mentors. In this case we enjoyed the following sessions in small groups:
 Market growth with: the CEO of CorkBIC, a former Microsoft BizDev VP, and the co-Founder &amp;amp; Director of Blippar Funding with: the Chair of Global Venture Forum, a Director at Woodside Capital, and a Partner at Delta Partners Group M&amp;amp;A/IPO with: the Principal M&amp;amp;A Integration at Google, a Managing Partner at Woodside Capital, and a Partner at Penningtons Manches Communication/PR with: the President of ActiveMedia, and the Associate Director at Oxygen PR  After that we had a policy hackathon competition (more about that in the next blog post).</description>

      <description>Monday, September 12, was the European Innovation Day (EID)at the Computer History Museumin Mountain View, CA.
Although the museum is not open on Mondays, we had access to a few of the exhibits, like the one about the IBM 1401, the awesome PDP-1 (Creating the Hacker Culture), and autonomous vehicles (and yes, of course, I go into a Google driverless car, and took a selfie).
But the reason why we went there was not (only) to see the museum but to participate in the EID event.</description>

      <description>One of the things that strikes me the most in this trip is how many homeless there are in SF. The income inequality is so obvious and insulting, it hurts. I know this is not a “SF-only” problem, but here it is a lot more visible than in many other cities.
As I walk from Union Sq. to Tender Nob through Geary or O’Farrell streets, or as I go to work in SOMA, I see homeless and people in need all over the sidewalk.</description>

      <description>After over 11 hours of flight from London in Virgin Atlantic, in which I caught up with movies I had not seen yet, I arrived in San Francisco Saturday, September 10.
Being as I am a sucker for all things Japanese, I got a room at the Hotel Kabuki, located in the middle of Japan Town.
I was tired from the long flight, but I took a walk around the Japan Center, and I`m glad I did, because I enjoyed going into Kinokuniya Bookstore, Daiso, Ichiban&amp;hellip; so hard to resist not buying everything!</description>

      <description>August 22-24 my wife and I went to Madrid, since she had not been there before.
We stayed at the wonderful Hotel Villa Magna, in Paseo de la Castellana. A very discreet luxury hotel where every single detail is just right, from the room amenities to the &amp;ldquo;just right&amp;rdquo; breakfast buffet.
The first day we visited the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía (MNCARS), where the budget cuts really show, although it continues to be a reference in contemporary art.</description>

In July we had tapas at Central Bar, visited the Torres de Serranos, and went to Viva Tapas Bar with friends.
In August we celebrated our anniversary at Ma Khin Café (nice, but we ended up there because our first four choices were closed), took John, a friend, to Bodego de la Sarieta, had cava sangria at the Cafe Negrito, and visited the Saint Nicholas church.</description>

      <description>On Saturday I went with my sister and brother-in-law on a day trip to my alma mater.
Although graduation ceremonies and hoards of tourists made it hard to move around and access temporarily closed buildings, it was a sunny day, and we enjoyed the walk, including a tour of Somerville and Magdalen Colleges, the Ashmolean Museum, a rehearsal for a concert at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, and the Bodleian Weston Library, where we saw the “Treasures: 24 pairs” exhibition and had a nice lunch.</description>

Answering NASA’s call to help contribute to the exploration of the solar system, I got access to their next-generation mission control framework being developed at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley being used for mission planning and operations in the lead up to the Resource Prospector mission, and at NASA`s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to view data from the Curiosity Rover.</description>

      <description>I live in Wimbledon. We moved here from London Bridge because this area is much more relaxed and has great parks within walking distance. But for two weeks a year, this town becomes the tennis capital of the world.
I can post this collection of photos showing how crazy the town gets for two weeks now that the Wimbledon Tennis Championships 2016 are over, and I can tell because I could hear the players moan, the umpire call the score… let alone the crowd roaring.</description>

      <description>After the trip to Boston I came down with the flu, of course on a weekend as usual. So Monday I had zero energy, but a week ahead with an usual large number of meetings around London, so I had to do “magic calendar tricks” to be able to make all of them and to also attend several events. The main “trick” is to concentrate meetings geographically, adding into the calendar the time it takes to go from point A to point B.</description>

Forbidden Planet is a comic store that I enjoyed tremendously while living in New York. While not exactly Tokyo’s Mandarake, Forbidden Planet had enough variety to make it interesting. What I did not know is that they had such a large store in London! It is a fun place full of comic (and non-comic) books, manga, merchandise, figures, posters…</description>

On Wednesday evening I had a very interesting conversation in Boston with both of them. Neither of them needs an introduction in the genomics world, but for those of you outside the field:
 Raminder is Vice-president at Eagle Genomics and Advisor at Kanteron Systems.</description>

But unfortunately, the schedule was so tight, that this time I did not have a minute to enjoy Boston’s museums or other attractions. But that does not mean that I did not enjoy it.
I stayed at the great Park Plaza Hotel, where they gave me a VIP treatment thanks to my wonderful travel agent @Cruise_Curator</description>

Although the show was small, it was a great opportunity to network with industry and academic experts (from Harvard Professors to Illumina executives) and learn.
From scientific posters to the latest sequencing technologies, from robotic arms to genomics experiments in space, it was great #geekfun.</description>

Each installment of their Deep Cuts series features a writer, artist, or curator discussing an underrated artist, artwork, movement, or museum.
In Episode 7: “Seriously playful” we discussed the work of one of my favorite artists: Claudio Zirotti.

Within Meschac Gaba (1961, Benin) “Architecture Room” installation part of the “Museum of Contemporary African Art” exhibit, the artist invitation was to build my own imaginary museum… and what better place to do that than in the recently inaugurated Switch House extension of the Tate Gallery by Herzog &amp;amp; de Meuron?</description>

      <description>On Tuesday June 21 I was invited to attend the Health Tech Innovators event that took place in London City Hall, organized by Digital Health London, MedCity, and Tech London Advocates.
It consisted of three panels (NHS, Innovators, and Corporate) and an open-bar networking.
Besides some interesting presentations, the main point as always was to network with old colleagues (like Sara – CEO of MedCity, Kay – Health Chair Tech London Advocates, Nooman – Silicon Valley Bank, or Hak – Advisor) and new ones (Brian – Partner PWC Health Advisory, Dough – Medical Director Aviva, John – Healthcare Konica Minolta, Marco – Health Solutions Janssen, Ifan – Healthcare Welsh Government, Martin – NIHR, Axel – ICL, and many more).</description>

      <description>For Father’s Day (we live in London, so we celebrate it today, unlike in Spain which is March 19) my wife gave me the “Ultimate Father`s Day” gift, from TechCamp UK. [Thank you, love!]
It consisted of a workshop with other father-son / father-daughter “teams”, held at the Iron Yard (The Leathermarket – London), where we built a desktop arcade machine in 5 hours (including lunch break), following the directions from Tom and Tom, using the Picadeset, setting up and using the Raspberry Pi, custom OS, emulators, ROMs, loudspeakers, power supply, LCD screen, etc:</description>

A good percentage (around 50%?) of works and an even higher percentage of galleries were the same as last year, but it was nonetheless interesting. As always.</description>

      <description>On Thursday, I was invited to attend the E2Exchange Annual National Reception at Banking Hall (London)
It started as a fun networking evening event, where I met all kinds of people, from VCs, to the owner of a large bank, to PR specialists… even a hypnotherapist!
Some politicians, like The Secretary of State for Business, had confirmed their attendance and were scheduled to debate Brexit, but they cancelled at the last minute due to the terrible murder of Jo Cox.</description>

      <description>Today I was invited to attend InfoSecurity Europe, Europe`s largest Information Security industry event.
As always, it was interesting to have a chance to catch up with this rapidly moving field, and a great opportunity to chat with old friends.
Apart from gimmicks (VR everywhere, car racing and helicopter simulators, giant robots, etc), swag (all kinds of Star Wars and other Sci-Fi related giveaways, from toys to t-shirts) and junk food (from candy to icecream to chips, the booths did not have healthy alternatives, although the food vendors did), the most interesting part of these events is always the talks, specifically the hands-on demos.</description>

Although a small event, it ended up being extremely interesting, with an area to try indie games and new technologies, and a long list of talks and panels, including one-on-ones.</description>

      <description>May 27 I was invited to participate in the “Computing in Cancer Workshop” organized by Microsoft Research in Cambridge.
It was a great opportunity to network, meet with colleagues and other researchers, and especially to learn a lot.
The fascinating lectures were:
 Antonio Criminisi (Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research): Machine Learning for Medical Image Analysis Jasmin Fisher (Senior Researcher, Microsoft Research): Virtual Models of Cancer Giles Maskell (President, Royal College of Radiologists): Current problems in diagnostic radiology Fiona Gilbert (Head of the Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge) Dennis Wang (Senior Bioinformatics Scientist, AstraZeneca): Predicting drug combinations and biomarkers of response: a crowd-sourced solution Florian Markowetz (University of Cambridge, CRUK Cambridge Institute): Quantifying patterns of tumour evolution Francesca Buffa (Associate Professor, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford): In-silico systems biology and functional genomics approaches to accelerate biomarker discovery Hoifung Poon (Researcher, Microsoft Research): Machine Reading for Cancer Panomics Raj Jena (Academic Consultant Clinical Oncologist, Cambridge University Hospitals): Computing for Radiation Oncology – from cell culture to the clinic Bertie Gottgens (Professor of Molecular Haematology, University of Cambridge): Defining Cell States and Regulatory Networks using Single Cell Genomics  </description>

      <description>Stockholm day 2:
We started the day with a very yummy breakfast buffet, which gave us plenty of energy for all the walking we had planned to do.
Since the National Museum was closed, we walked along the Strandvägen and crossed the Djurgårdsbron bridge into Djurgården to go to the Vasa Muséet.
The Vasa museum is quite an amazing place, a lot more interesting than it seems at first: it displays the only almost fully intact 17th century ship that has ever been salvaged, the 64-gun warship Vasa that sank on her maiden voyage in 1628.</description>

      <description>After the wonderful cruise, we disembarked in Stockholm and took a taxi to our hotel: the Nobis . It is a cool design hotel, with a particular claim to history: in their building is where the Stockholm Syndrome effect first happened. It is located in a square where they are installing heated floors!
After storing our luggage in the hotel (too early to checking-in), we went off to explore the city.</description>

      <description>Friday, May 20, we arrived in Helsinki quite early and docked by Kauppatori (Market Square) where they sell a ton of berries (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, etc), which we have been eating a ton during the cruise.
So, after breakfast we disembarked, and walked the Senate Square, got a map in the City Hall, where we also took the opportunity to check our email thanks to the free wifi, and went on, passing by the Helsinki Cathedral, the Palace of the Council of the State, the main building of the University of Helsinki, and the National Library.</description>

      <description>Thursday, May 19 we had an early breakfast again and were met by Slava who drove us to Peterhof, as Marina told us stories of Soviet era daily life.
Peterhof is another one of those tourist destinations that can get unbearably packed, so I truly appreciated that my wife and Marina arranged for a special visit before they officially opened their doors.
It is amazing the excruciatingly detailed job the Soviets did to document, preserve, and restore the palace, including using original equipment to weave the tapestries and silk.</description>

      <description>Wednesday, May 18 we asked Marina to start the day visiting the subway (Metro), which gave us an opportunity to have an interesting political and historical discussion. I still remember the monumental Moscow’s Metro. While Saint Petersburg’s Metro is not as spectacular, there are many examples of Soviet era art and decoration. The Metro itself is old but impeccably clean and maintained.
Marina insisted in inviting us to a cup of tea at the famous Yeliseevskiy Gastronom at 56 Nevskiy Prospekt.</description>

After clearing immigration (you need a visa to enter Russia, unless you have arranged private escorted tours like we had), we were met by Slava, our driver, who for the next three days would take us everywhere in a large white Mercedes Benz.</description>

Right after breakfast we took the shuttle to go downtown (although it is so close that it was quite unnecessary). Tallinn is a small city, being Estonia the smallest of all Baltic states.</description>

      <description>On days at sea during cruises, we tend to oversleep. And that’s exactly what happened. Sunday May 15 was a day at sea, and we did not get up until noon (in our defense we will say that during this cruise we crossed the time zone lines several times, so it was difficult to keep the right time in mind).
We headed directly for lunch at the restaurant. It was so empty, that we had to double check.</description>

The ship is absolutely fantastic. It’s fairly new, exquisitely decorated, and we were assigned an amazing suite with a walk-in closet. Of particular excellence was the suite’s bathroom. I have only seen such a great bathroom in places like The Ritz Carlton Hotel (any, since they are all the same) or the UAE Emir’s Palace.</description>

Those three days were very nice: we went for walks in the parks and village, we enjoyed the flowers blooming and seeing families have fun and catch their vitamin-D-processing-sun-ray-yearly-dose, and we had a lovely breakfast in our castle’s balcony seeing a group of elders play cricket in the Wimbledon Practice Courts.
It was nice, albeit brief, Summer.</description>

      <description>For a couple of days (May 3-4), IBM executives from Switzerland, France and Spain came to my company’s headquarters in Spain for a “technical deep dive”.
During those technical discussions (under NDA, so I’m afraid I can’t reveal any of what was said) other IBM executives dialed in from their respective countries.
Beyond engineering, market, and corporate discussions, we also had an opportunity to have fun. On day one we had a typical paella on the beach.</description>

On one side, 0.3 miles to the East, we have the family-friendly and very civilized Wimbledon Park, with its swans and ducks, water sports, minigolf, tennis courts… even beach volleyball!
On the other side, 0.3 miles to the West, we have the wild and lush dense forest of Wimbledon Common:
Adjacent to Wimbledon Common we have Richmond Park, with its live and free roaming deer.</description>

      <description>After a year living by London Bridge, we have decided to move out. Our apartment was nice, and the location quite convenient, but the constant flood of tourists to the Borough Market and the Bridge made me feel just like I did when I lived in Mid-Town/5th Avenue Manhattan (New York) a few years ago. Back then, just like now, I decided to move to an area that felt more “neighborhood” and less “tourist landmark” (in that case it was Chelsea), and it proved to be the right choice.</description>

      <description>Tuesday March 1 I had a conversation with Dr. DJ Patil, the First White House Chief Data Scientist, at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.
He was interested in discussing ways in which the White House can help healthcare technology companies like mine. The first issue I raised was my concern over the FBI’s request for Apple to decrypt a suspected criminal’s iPhone.
My position in this issue is well known: weak encryption means weak security for ALL of us, so nobody can request weak security for security’s sake.</description>

Hitachi, one of our partners, asked my company to be part of their booth for the second year in a row, and I was very glad to share the booth with them and another open source company they recently acquired: Pentaho.
Throughout the duration of the show I had numerous business breakfasts (including a very early one with IBM and their new CEO of Watson Health, who until recently was CEO of Philips Healthcare), lunches and dinners, and was invited to several events, like Microsoft’s party at the Bodies exhibition in the Luxor Hotel, and Lexmark’s party.</description>

      <description>On February 25 a group of medical imaging researchers from Microsoft came to our company’s headquarters in Valencia (Spain) for a day-long workshop on bleeding edge medical image software.
I must admit that just a few years ago I would have laughed at the idea of such an occurrence for many reasons. But things change, and now Microsoft is much more open (and convinced) about Open Source software, their researchers have demonstrated exceptional ability in advanced medical imaging analysis algorithms (unlike their failed business strategy around Amalga), and my company has grown and innovated to the point where it captures the interest and even enthusiasm of some of the largest technology companies in the world.</description>

      <description>On February 23 Microsoft invited me to an industry event at Sushi Samba, which is located on the 39th floor of the Heron Tower in London.
I have never given a standing presentation right next to a floor to ceiling window with the clouds closer to me than the ground!
The event was nice, as it was the venue. Thank you for inviting me, Microsoft.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was invited to attend the official launch of the Mayor’s International Programmeat City Hall, London, where I met some of London`s top entrepreneurs, mentors, and the Mayor (who gave a short speech using 007 as a reference).
One of my companies (Kanteron Systems) has been selected as one of the 35 companies forming the initial cohort.
The programme will support high growth businesses from London’s Technology, Life Sciences and Urban sectors to expand their businesses internationally.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we went to see a couple exhibitions at Somerset House, in London.
The first exhibition we saw was “TINTIN: Hergé`s Masterpiece”. Basic but obviously appealing, it was too crowded to be enjoyable.
The second one was “Big Bang Data”.
While undoubtedly interesting, especially for someone who works in, teaches, and loves bid data and technology like myself, to me the most interesting aspect of this exhibition is that everyone who was there had already experienced the subject.</description>

      <description>As an international &amp;ldquo;solo-preneur&amp;rdquo; you have to be careful about how to invest your time and resources, and what metrics are really key.
My main company (Kanteron Systems) is in the Enterprise Healthcare Software world. Blog posts and books talking about apps, user adoption, and monetization mean nothing to me. Yet most companies in the Enterprise B2B space are big listed multinationals, so their metrics do not exactly apply to me either.</description>

Titled “EmpoweringHealth: the journey towards more personalized, productive, collaborative and predictive health services &amp;amp; systems” it took place at the Microsoft Executive Briefing Center in Brussels.I participated in the round table “Medical Imaging Storage in the Cloud”, moderated by Kelly Limonte (Microsoft UK Healthcare Team), and in the Expert Panel “The future of preventive and predictive health powered by data in the intelligent cloud”, along with:</description>

      <description>On Wednesday, January 20th I flew to Miami, on the top floor of a double-decker plane, for a quick meeting at the airport. Unfortunately, and as usual, the delay of the aircraft, together with the immigration queue, and a traffic jam in which my client was caught, made the meeting impossible.
From Miami, I flew all night to Santiago de Chile.Arriving in Santiago, as always my good friend and distributor picked me up from the airport and took me to the hotel to check-in, shower and change to go to the first meeting.</description>

      <description>Monday the 18 of January I went to Liverpool for a business meeting. The first one in a very large project with England’s National Health System.
It was a quick trip, that started off the right way, with a “Game of Thrones” chair made out of electric guitars at the station, and Virgin giving me an upgrade to First Class. I usually can care less about traveling in first class for short train rides.</description>

      <description>On January 3 I took my wife, along with my parents, to visit one of my childhood “safe places”: Moraira and Javea, in Alicante’s White Coast.
Alongside Ibiza, always my favorite, Moraira’s beaches have a very special place in my memory.
While it has grown a lot in population and housing developments, being a “prime real estate” area (and therefore rich town), they have made a pretty good job keeping it nice and beautiful.</description>

      <description>For almost a month between mid-December and mid-January we escaped London’s grey sky and went to Valencia (Spain) to meet my team for some strategic sessions, and to be with the family.
The first thing we did was to behave like tourists, craving serrano ham, freshly squeezed orange juice, paella, or walks on the beach.
It’s easy to see how clichés are formed, being nothing else than the brain’s reductionist tendencies at play.</description>

      <description>On December 4 I was lucky enough to be invited to visit Ai Weiwei`s exhibition at the Royal Academy.
I knew I would enjoy it since Ai Weiwei is one of my favourite artists. I knew even my son, my wife and my mother-in-law would enjoy it, since Ai Weiweis art is highly figurative and symbolic, even to the point of being obvious with his latest works (which makes its appeal that more far-reaching if slightly less elitist).</description>

      <description>In the past few days I have had quite a few &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; meetings.
On November 26 I was invited to the Pre-Christmas Reception at HSBC corporate offices, along with other business owners/entrepreneurs: a weird mix of industries and interests (which I find a complete waste of business networking time). But one thing was completely homogeneous: wherever you looked, there were men. Middle aged, white, balding, dark suit-wearing men. Just like me.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, after spending the day at a tradeshow in Düsseldorf, on my way by train to the hotel in Mülheim, I stopped in the town of Duisburg, which was on my way, because I heard they were setting up a Christmas market. The market was indeed being set up, but it was still closed, so I decided to go back to the station. To avoid the sprinkling rain I took the 901 tram at König-Heinrich Platz.</description>

Lots of walking, trains, meetings, and random thoughts:
 Why does the baker not let me take a picture of one of their St. Martin`s Day &amp;ldquo;Weckmann”? There was a time, years ago, when I could speak some German.</description>

On Wednesday I had dinner with some business partners; “business as usual”.
But on Thursday, after my business presentation to potential customers, I had the very rare and exclusive opportunity to visit one of the main data centers in Switzerland. Here are some impressive facts about them:
 they host 1/3 of Swiss banks data internet traffic = 40% of Switzerland’s internet traffic energy bill = 2 million Swiss Franks per annum 2 different energy suppliers from 2 different access points, with preferential oil supply in case of a failure (full reserves for 5 days for the generators) almost 50 telecoms suppliers, from many different countries, providing direct access for their customers worldwide RFIDs paired with 3D fingerprint scanners which measure the fingerprint but also the morphology, pulse and temperature separate isolated room to open packages, to minimize the risk of fire single person magnetic doors temperature, movement, and sound sensors double-gated entrance even to the parking lot!</description>

      <description>Tuesday was a very nice day in London, which was convenient because I decided to walk to my two appointments, which were quite far apart.
First I met with a PR firm. You know their founders are into art when in the meeting room we were in (one of many) they had a J. Opie and a W. Hewett. Nice. Bonus points.
Then I walked to the Japanese Embassy, where I had been invited to a symposium on big data research for dementia (actually, I chuckled when I thought that, in a way, it could be argued that “big data seems to cause dementia in some vendors”) 😉</description>

It was my first time on the Eurostars train, and I love it: to be able to work all the way from downtown London to downtown Paris, without wasting time going back and forth airports, and having a very reliable punctuality, is great.
In Paris I met a business partner briefly at the Gare du Lyon, and then my customers at Le Train Blue restaurant and business space.</description>

      <description>Sunday November 8th we went to the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Science Museum for some educational fun weekend.
I love the V&amp;amp;A for its interesting variety. We saw sculptures (although lot more Rodin than Bernini), Medieval objects (from reliquaries to clothing and drawings), and some fine examples of Japanese design.
In the Science Museum we went to see the small but extremely interesting exhibition on Ada Lovelace’s history. We learned a lot and I believe it was a great inspiration to my son.</description>

You need a special permit to use their volumes, but they have a very active schedule of events and presentations, and a wonderful museum.
Amongst the “treasures” they have, there are manuscripts from Mozart (‘Verzeichnüss aller meiner Werke’), Beethoven, Magna Carta, John Lennon, Percy Bysshe Shelley (‘The Mask of Anarchy’), and many other historically relevant documents, like the first printed music in western musical notation using Gutemberg’s movable type (Southern Germany c.</description>

The ceremony offers companies joining London Stock Exchange’s markets the opportunity to mark their success on the day of their admission. The event was followed by drinks and breakfast.
The reason why I was invited is because one of my companies (Kanteron Systems) had been selected as a member of the #ScaleUpClub 2015.</description>

      <description>On Thursday, coming back home from a meeting, I run into the Million Masks March. While I assume I agree with most of their anti-system protests (the truth is I did not bother to read them), I think their choice of Guy Fawkes as an &amp;ldquo;icon&amp;rdquo;, even if a graphical one as proposed by the comic/movie &amp;ldquo;V for Vendetta&amp;rdquo;, is a very stupid one. Just read about what that historical figure had in mind and judge for yourself.</description>

It was a great collection of pieces, but I particularly liked (or was most shocked by) the work of Tomas van Houtryve (2nd prize stories), Cai Sheng Xiang (1st prize singles), Turi Calafato (3rd prize stories), and Arash Khamooshi (3rd prize stories).
Definitely worthwhile visiting.</description>

      <description>I have business meetings all the time. Sometimes in person, sometimes via videoconference.
It’s always about the people you meet, and the business you discuss. But sometimes, the location is extraordinary, or fun, or interesting for whatever reason. So once in a while I will add a few comments or pictures about those meetings. For example, check out the views from the 32nd floor of the Tower 42 building, or the reception room of the Royal Institute of British Architects!</description>

Not only it was hosted at one of my favorite venues in London, but the selection of works by contemporary illustrators was quite good. The one I liked the most was Malika Favre’s Futurist-inspired posters for the BAFTAs 2015, but there were many remarkable ones, like Bartosz Kosowskis perfect poster for Kubricks Lolita, the cheerfully cute drawings of Chris Haughton for the Royal London Children`s Hospital, the super busy &amp;ldquo;Larger Than line&amp;rdquo; by Mattias Adolfsson, the powerful and colorful &amp;ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&amp;rdquo; art by Grahame Baker-Smith, or the iconic &amp;ldquo;Autism&amp;rdquo; work by Aad Goudappel (one copy of which I acquired for our private collection).</description>

Some quick notes from that trip and event: always delighted with Portuguese food; lots of European executives speaking weak English with strong accents; fake smiles and a surprising amount of distrust amongst “business partners” hidden under fake camaraderie (is this a “European thing”?</description>

But since it was late in the day, I decided to make the most of it, so I checked out of the hotel early, hopped on the subway (with a little help from a British Airways flight attendant), and headed to Shibuya, where I left my luggage in a coin locker, got a map (just in case, although I feel I know the area well), and started walking around Cat Street, Omotesando, and Takeshita Dori.</description>

It was out of the way, but I read great things about it, so not caring about pictures not turning out OK or getting lost, or getting wet, I went anyway.
I can only assume that the place was mostly empty because of the suboptimal weather, but I was very very happy to walk around there almost by myself.</description>

 Someone said that when you can’t or don’t know how to share, you become an exhibitionist. Is that why I have a blog?
 In any case, after seeing a little presentation about the safety and earthquake-resistant features of the world’s fastest elevator, built by Mitsubishi, I got to ride it, at 750 m/s, to the top on the 69th floor.</description>

      <description>Before a very successful day at the trade show (few but extremely interesting meetings with the likes of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a very large Japanese company known for their electronics, and a BioTech fund from Silicon Valley), I went to the Red Brick Warehouse. I read online someone saying it was the cool alternative to a shopping center, and it was close by, so I decided to check it out for myself.</description>

      <description>It was time to work. The trade show I was in Yokohama for, BioJapan, is not a big one, and dwarfs in comparison to the Bio show in the USA. But being so highly specialized means that there are less people attending that in other trade shows, and the people attending are all directly involved in life sciences, either as researchers or as companies commercializing life sciences research (or providing support and services).</description>

      <description>The next day it was my (almost) free day. Absolutely necessary, specially for those who are not used to long flights and big time zone differences. Not my case, but I’m still glad I had that day off… specially in Japan!
So I got up early, dealt with my emails as quickly as I could, had tradicional Japanese breakfast, I met my friend and client Komaki-san, and after the meeting I left the hotel.</description>

Since the departure of the London-Abu Dhabi was delayed, I did not have time to have a meeting or even explore the airport in Abu Dhabi.</description>

      <description>It is quite a privilege to be able to take your son to the British Museum every week for his homeschooling history class. And that’s what we did Friday October 9, but this time I also took my wife and the in-laws.
Visiting a museum on a regular basis allows for much deeper analysis and engagement, gaining on the depth the exhibits have and most tourist don’t have the time to enjoy.</description>

      <description>It had been quite a long time since I was last at the National Gallery, but Tuesday October 6 I took my family there. While my in-laws were visiting, for my home-schooled son was Art class time. I enjoyed tremendously discussing with him the differences between early and late Renaissance visual art.
Even if was only for the proximity to some of the world’s best museums, living in London is great.</description>

      <description>Monday October 5 I took my family to the Sky Garden, at 20 Fenchurch St., London. It’s the UK’s highest public garden, and it’s free to visit although an online reservation is required.
Honestly, I wonder how come it took me so long to check it out. It’s awesome!
Despite the hordes of visitors, it does not feel overly crowded, offering different levels and spaces from where to admire the amazing view of London.</description>

      <description>I can not have enough of Oxford. Being there is like being in another world: a timeless, self-contained, engrossing, and intellectual stimulating one. And you don’t even need to be a student or to attend a lecture to feel it. On Sunday October 4 I visited with my wife, my son and my parents-in-law.
I took them to the college I attended and others, enjoying their architecture and gardens, marveling at the incredible amount of cultural events (mainly concerts and lectures, not so much art, though) going on for such a small town.</description>

      <description>[More pictures here]
Last Saturday I had the pleasure to attend Oxford’s Alumni Weekend with my son.
I knew he would not be the only teenager there, but I was surprised to see kids even younger than him accompanying their parents. The truth is that I wish I had brought him earlier. I’ll try to bring my daughter to the next one.
Besides the obvious networking opportunity, the true pleasure was to attend interesting lectures delivered by top academics, and to see my son actually interested in those lectures!</description>

      <description>Everybody is too busy. It’s the “toxic work world” we live in, accordingto the New York Times. But some days are more ridiculously packed than others.
Last week I had so many meetings, it was hard for me to keep track of them. Some that I remember off the top of my head: meeting with a General Partner of Google Ventures, meeting two executives from the National Health Service (NHS), an executive from Accenture at their posh London offices, being interviewed by an Editor from The Times, being picked up by a driver in a hybrid car with wifi who took me to a media event (Haymarket Group’s Create 2015) to present and participate in a panel along two other accomplished “entrepreneurs” from TechHub, and minutes later participating at another event (Connected Health) at Simmons &amp;amp; Simmons.</description>

      <description>These past few days have been quite “playful”.
On the one hand, I have just discovered, right around the corner from our apartment by London Bridge, a free and public playground that has an artificial grass hockey field, half a basketball court, 3 pingpong tables and even a beach volleyball court with sand and all! So obviously, the next day I went with my son to a sports equipment store and bought a soccer ball, a pingpong set, a basketball, a volleyball and a badminton set.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I attended the 11th Medical Innovations Summitheld at the Royal Society of Medicine.
Like everyone else, I usually attend these events because there is a chance you may get to actually listen to an interesting presenter, or learn about a true innovation. But I usually leave disappointed due to a number of reasons like too much hype and lack of substance, bad organisation, “innovations” that are not really innovations, or bad presenters.</description>

      <description>On Friday I attended the 20/21 British Art Fairat the Royal College of Art, in London.
Usually I love art fairs, and find many exciting works of art. I particularly love the creative energy you can feel at contemporary art fairs.
This one was not an exciting fair. Perhaps because it is modern and contemporary, perhaps because it is limited to British artists, or perhaps because this year’s selection was not that interesting.</description>

      <description>Last month we took the kids to an idyllic English countryside retreat: the Four Seasons Hampshire, where we stayed in two adjacent suites.
Not far from London, it has everything a kid can dream of for a wonderful countryside vacation: green hills, a fishing pond, clay pigeon shooting, indoors heated swimming pool, bicycles, a large collection of DVDs, library, a playground, a rope-adventure course, a crocket lawn, tennis courts, a kids playroom with videogames, foosball, pool table… even a resident black labrador dog called Oliver!</description>

Due to the personal nature of this post, I will keep it brief and pictures, as usual in this blog for privacy reasons, will not show my kids.

Although some years ago we went to Legoland Billund, we wanted to check this one out. As expected, it was a lot of fun (especially if you are a Lego fan… and who isn’t?</description>

One was a very rare and wonderful find: an original Ukiyo-e woodblock print by Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849), whose &amp;ldquo;Great Wave off Kanagawa&amp;rdquo; is one of the best-known works of Japanese art, titled “Wavy shadow of Mount Fuji” from the “One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji, Vol. 2” Series, created in 1835. The “One Hundred Views of Mount Fuji” series was featured by the British Museum in 2001and is part of the MET Museum collectionin New York.</description>

It was a blast! Many booths with Japanese merchandise, videogames (with a huge Nintendo area), clothing (like Aoior the supercool t-shirts of Askew Gaming), manga artists, publishers (like Kaori, or Kodansha), bookstores (like JP Books), jewelry (like LittleMooseor Jane Nevermore), designers (like Ayako Shirata), art galleries (like CelGaor The Japanese Gallery), tourism info and institutions (like Japan Foundation), Japanese schools (like Alpha), steampunk (like Mikie &amp;amp; Co.</description>

It was quite a shock comparing the overall tone and spirit to the same event in New York, last year.
In New York everything was oriented toward networking, and you had the feeling that anyone could be anyone, and it didn`t matter if they represented a large company or a &amp;ldquo;start-up wannabe&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Those meetings are important for the future of my company, and I did learn quite a few things, while they help me select the &amp;ldquo;super-star team&amp;rdquo; that will allow me to take my company to the next level.
But I have also enjoyed running around London, from meeting to meeting, while keeping my eyes (and camera) up in &amp;ldquo;tourist mode&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>My wonderful wife already gave me the best birthday present ever when she invited me to stay at the Bvlgari Hotel in London and dinner at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal at the Mandarin Oriental.
But for next year (since this year we had to cancel our Polynesian cruise) she has decided to up the ante, and has invited me to an amazing 15 day cruise in April 2016, on the Luxury Silversea Silver Shadowcalling at:</description>

      <description>This morning I was invited to the launch of London Technology Week, which was held at The Shard.
Besides your typical mix of VIPs, politicians, and media, the most outstanding thing was the view 😉
You can read the details of the press release here.
PS.- Some constructive criticism:
 In an event like this &amp;ldquo;Technology&amp;hellip; whatever&amp;rdquo; you need a hashtag (something like #LTW15) A Technology Week is full of events, how about a MAP, CALENDAR, or an APP to show them all, and to sign up?</description>

      <description>Today we went to the Affordable Art Fair Hampstead. With over 100 galleries, it was a real pleasure. We saw some artists that we like and have seen in quite a few shows before, and discovered many new ones that were quite interesting.
In no particular order, my non-comprehensive list would include many artists, like:
 Adele Moreau Max Naylor Edvardas Racevicius Andy Wilx, etc  And the whole selection of Galleries like:</description>

      <description>On Thursday, June 11 I attended the London New Tech Meeting at Google Campus.
It was a typical presentation format (5 companies, 5 minutes). I enjoyed some of the presentations, specially since two of the projects sounded very very promising. Unfortunately they were not even MVP with a landing page. I hope they make it so we can all benefit from their cool ideas.
Since it was a nice day, on my way back home I noticed how the typical beer-drinking crowd had multiplied by hundreds, and they were all drinking and being cheerly loud out on the streets.</description>

      <description>Today I went on an &amp;ldquo;art walk&amp;rdquo;. Since the first Thursday of each month many art galleries in London remain open until late and host special events (an awesome initiative). Unfortunately I left quite late from the office, but I was working on a very special deal, so I could not leave earlier.
First I visited Boxpark Shoreditch.
 &amp;ldquo;Situated in the heart of east London’s fashion and art district, two floors of sixty shipping containers began as the world’s first pop up mall.</description>

It was a blast. A geek blast. Many featured projects, such as giant drone, hydrogen racing car prototype, alternative transportation infrastructure, robotic fish, or improved artificial heart valve design, along with entertainment: giant Scalextric racing, giant jinga, FIFA 15 tournament, impact simulators, pool, and a live concert by Cable Street Collective.

First of all, let me congratulate the savvy business and marketing team behind it. They put together a well though-out package, their idea is unique and very interesting: a videogame that will reward players by sending them real gold + investors buying &amp;ldquo;mines&amp;rdquo; in the game and participating in the profits.</description>

But a man has to eat, so on Saturday I went to the Maltby Street Market.</description>

The venue was ideal: some of the best views in London. As a matter of fact that meeting room is often used as a recording studio.
Networking events are quite useful if they are industry focused, if someone already knows everyone and introduces to those who may have specific synergy (or if everybody has a chance to quickly introduce themselves).</description>

      <description>On Tuesday I introduced my company officially to the Google Campus London community, with a &amp;ldquo;pitch&amp;rdquo;.
It didn`t surprise me to see the relaxed &amp;ldquo;cool startup&amp;rdquo; vibe, or the fact that it was full of entrepreneurs. What surprised me is how much people liked my pitch. I ran out of business cards!
It was interesting to hear what those entrepreneurs are working on: from a Polish working on &amp;ldquo;on-demand concierge services&amp;rdquo;, to a Russian with &amp;ldquo;personality analysis applied to finances&amp;rdquo;, or an Egyptian/Spanish couple working on &amp;ldquo;social-selling fashion&amp;rdquo;.</description>

The Poetry Comics exhibition at the Saison Poetry Library(Royal Festival Hall) – the largest poetry library in the UK.-

For example, in less than 5 minutes’ walk from our apartment, and without even crossing the London Bridge, we have the Tate Modern(Britain`s national gallery of international modern art), Shakespeare’s Globe Theater, Southbank Centre(Europe’s largest centre for the arts: theatres, concert halls and a cutting edge art gallery presenting over 1200 events each year), and BFI Southbank(the leading repertory cinema in the UK, specialising in classic, independent and non-English language films, operated by the British Film Institute).</description>

      <description>I have been working at the Google-TechHub Campus in Shoreditch (the “Silicon Roundabout”) London for a few weeks. It is really cool. In no particular order, here are some things I love about this place:
 A cafeteria (open to anyone) with terrace, foosball table, bitcoin machine, device bar (to test your developments in many different devices) and even a spacesuit! A small but well stocked library of tech books Very nice team, from security to reception, to admin, to social media… all of them Two levels of office space, one of them (supposedly) “quiet zone” Unlimited supplies of toast and tea, great wifi, and good scanners/printers A ton of areas to sit down and have a meeting, not just the “meeting rooms” Most importantly: the events.</description>

Moving to a new country is not such an impossible task as some people imagine, but it is definitely quite a challenge.
The first thing you have to do is to forget comparisons. No place is perfect, and no place is completely awful. But one can’t help but to be stuck by “peculiarities” of the place. Here are some random ones we have been laughing or crying about:</description>

      <description>Saturday, May 2, was our last day at sea. We got up late, but still on time to have breakfast at the Britannia restaurant. At 10 am we attended a very interesting lecture by Aldon Ferguson on Covert Operations in the Cold War. After yet another time change, we had lunch followed by an unexpected nap.
We graciously avoided the Guest Talent Show, and went to the Library instead, to catch up on some work and return the books we had checked out.</description>

      <description>On Friday, May 1, our bodies finally caught up with all the pre-cruise accumulated stress, by sleeping until 1pm, taking into account the time change. So we headed straight to lunch (“would you like some coffee with your steak and kidney pie, dear?”), followed by a very nice walk around the deck.
After the afternoon tea we worked with our laptops in the Library. My wife decided to go back to the room early, so she could get ready for the formal dinner and Masquerade Ball, while sipping rosé champagne.</description>

      <description>On Thursday, April 30, we made a resolution to get up early (7am is early even if you are not on a Transatlantic crossing!) so we could have breakfast at 8am and join the fencing class at 9am. There is something wonderfully stylish and timeless about fencing in the ballroom of Cunard’s Queen Victoria.
After the fencing class we went back to the stateroom to shower, and then straight to a Galley Tour, where we inspected the cooking areas.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday, April 29, as the Commodore announced we were right “in the middle of our crossing,” we woke up really late. You realize how late when the steward greets you “good afternoon,” and you go straight to lunch (right after my wife’s immigration procedure). It was surprising, at least to me, that although we were half an hour late for that scheduled process, 80 people were still to show up, most of the from the USA.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday, April 28, we finally woke up early enough to enjoy a full service breakfast at the Britannia restaurant and attend the morning lecture “Meteors, Meteorites and Comets”, by Howard L.G. Parkin. While the Royal Court Theater was fairly full, by the time his lecture was over, it completely filled out for the next lecture: “Survival in Solitude”, where Terry Waite told us how, while working as negotiator for the Archbishop of Canterbury, he was taken hostage in Beirut and survived for 5 years, 4 of which he spent in solitary confinement, enduring torture and a mock execution.</description>

Parkin “The Constellations – Myth, Legend And Mystery”, right after which we attender another lecture, this time by Simon Dinsdale, in which he shared some of his experiences as a Royal Family bodyguard.
After a light lunch, we went to the library.</description>

      <description>April 26 we woke up quite late, with the wonderful feeling of not having to rush, and enjoyed a nice breakfast buffet at the Lido restaurant.
After breakfast we took a walk around the ship, exploring the different venues, from the card room to the library. It is definitely not a “flashy” ship, with the decor being elegantly subtle and conservative. Perhaps the weakest point, as with so many cruise ships, being the artwork, and the most interesting one being the Cunardia (the first Cunard museum at sea) celebrating 175 years of history.</description>

The night before we had a farewell dinner with some friends in New York at White Street restaurant, which was full of movie industry VIPs already invading Manhattan for the Tribeca Film Festival; our friend Jill, who could not attend the dinner, had a very nice gesture sending a bottle of champagne and a card from Washington DC.</description>

      <description>On April 14th I was invited to have breakfast with IBM executives on a private yacht (with a helicopter on the stern) in Chicago.
It was a unique opportunity to discuss the future of healthcare and technology, and my company, with the most senior executives in the company, in a very beautiful setting.
Thank you!</description>

      <description>April 12th to 15th we went to Chicago, to attend the largest Healthcare IT show in the world (HIMSS), presenting Kanteron Systems solutions at the Hitachi Data Systems booth.
We stayed at The Public Hotel. We made friends, had fun (thank you for inviting us to the Lexmark Healthcare party, Jeff), and enjoyed the nice weather!
Oh, yeah, and we worked a lot too.</description>

      <description>March 31st we went to London with a very defined mission: to find an apartment, get cell phone lines, open bank accounts, and get the office space running. All in two days and a half, because although we did return to Spain on April 3rd, it was a bank holiday.

We had to run all over the city. The amazing thing? WE DID IT! Well, kinda.
The office was easy, since we had already been selected to join the Google Campus in London.</description>

      <description>On March 23rd I was named Technology Advisor to the 250 year old Saint Charles Royal Academy of Fine Arts by its 56th president, Dr. Manuel Muñoz.
The Royal Academy has the second largest and most important classical painting collection in Spain, after Madrid`s Museo del Prado.
Technology and Art are two of my passions, so combining the two sounds like a very exciting proposition.</description>

      <description>We had the pleasure to spend the second half of March with the kids and the rest of the family in Valencia (Spain).
My Canadian in-laws had never seen Fallas, the crazy annual festival that leaves the whole city literally up in flames every March 19th, after over a week of outdoor concerts, food, parades, firecrackers and fireworks.
We enjoyed paella, &amp;ldquo;chocolate con buñuelos&amp;rdquo;, live flamenco&amp;hellip; but without a doubt, the highlight was to be able to experience the “mascletá” firecracker extravaganza from the most vantage position: the balcony of a private bank’s offices in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento (thanks again, Antonio!</description>

      <description>This past winter I met Sandy and James from Open ITP in New York, and Pepe from Valencia. They were organizing the Circumvention Tech Festivalto be held in Las Naves, Valencia (Spain) March 1-6.
They invited me to give a talk, which was eventually scheduled for March 4th at 3pm. I titled the talk “When privacy does not mean the same to you and me”. It was meant to generate debate, to expose other people’s points of view, rather than to be a unidirectional speech.</description>

      <description>Yes, the rumor is true: my wife and I are moving to London.
Now that Kanteron USA is solidly stablished, and profitable, I must proceed with the expansion plan, and make sure to grow both Asia and EMEA markets, which I plan to do from London.
So, although we are moving April 25th (more on that in another post, since it will be quite a singular &amp;ldquo;adventure&amp;rdquo;), this was our last weekend in New York because this upcoming weekend we will be in Canada, and next Friday we fly to Europe, where we will be visiting Lisbon, Valencia, Rome and London.</description>

      <description>After a quick trip to Baltimore, I had to fly to Dubai for a series of business meetings and to attend a trade show.
While a 12 hour and 7000 mile flight is never fun, Emirates award-winning on board entertainment system in the new A380-800 Jet is a joy. Not for the interface, a little outdated, but for the large screen and seemingly endless selection. Then again, all I need to make it through any long flight is an AC plug, which this plane had, so I was golden.</description>

      <description>In December I went to Valencia (Spain) on a business and personal trip. Besides the always sweet family moments (in one of which I was subjected to an artistic transformation in which both my face and my scalp were used as an improvised canvas), there were three things I particularly enjoyed: the Christmas lunch (Spanish tradition, in lieu of the office party) I prepared at the office for the whole team; to finally try the Oculus Riff with my dad and my son at the videogame exhibitionat the Valencian Museum of Illustration and Modernity [sic] (MuVIM); and a paella at a family member`s farm in the middle of a Valencian field.</description>

We had the kids visit NY from Spain. As usual I never post pictures or give details of other family members in my blog, but we did have a blast: Empire State Building, Central Park, Museum of Math (MoMath), Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), twice dinner at Cafeteria and ice-cream at Amorinos, American Museum of Natural History, the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, chatting with the squirrels at Washington Square Park, Forbidden Planet comics, The Strand bookstore, Grand Central Station&amp;hellip; and to top it off we spent a day at the Poconos Camelback mountain snow-tubbing.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday 17 I arrived in Malaga (Spain) via Zurich for a couple of important business meetings. The meetings went really well, but I also enjoyed this very special city.
It had been a while since I was last in Malaga, so I went back to my favorite places: La Tetería teashop (right in front of the Picasso Museum), and the Contemporary Art Center CAC, where they have a small but always excellent and ever-changing display of works.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday my wife and I were invited to the MoMA member reception “The Forever Now: Contemporary Painting in an Atemporal World”, which opens officially tomorrow for the general public.
Obviously the rain did not prevent hordes of socialites to flock to MoMA and gather around one of the three open bars. But that was great because it gave us, and quite a few other &amp;ldquo;they must be on a How About We date&amp;rdquo; couples to visit some of the galleries without having to use our elbows.</description>

      <description>For a few days after Thanksgiving we enjoyed having my parents stay with us in our Chelsea apartment. Visitors are always a great excuse to go to those places that are “too touristy” to go to, even if we like them.
This time we devoted almost a whole day (November 30) to Chinatown, where we enjoyed delicious (and really affordable) dim sum at Dim Sum Go Go.
We also had a blast at the “AllCityStyletoy subway trains for graffiti” display in Grand Central Station, and enjoyed a great lunch at Kitchen by David Burkeon our way to the 9/11 Memorial.</description>

      <description>Iban M. G. and Ben Martin have launched a writing project that breaks the boundaries of typical book in paper/digital format. Over the years I have seen many attempts to push the publishing world further. All commendable and appreciated. But so far I have not seen any project as ambitious as HTO.
Note: Literary review aside. I have not read the novel yet and, as a matter of fact, that`s irrelevant for the purposes of this post.</description>

      <description>Since my parents were visiting from Spain, we decided to drive with them to Buffalo to spend Thanksgiving all together with my in-law family.
Wednesday, November 26 we drove over 400 miles (650 Km) through the snow stormfrom New York City to Niagara Falls. Well, my wife drove. I don’t think anyone else in the car could have managed all that snow and ice on the road, but fortunately she has a lot of experience with it, so while it took us four more hours than expected (and forced us to stop at a diner in the middle of the road for lunch, instead of making it to Ithaca as it was our plan), we made it across the Canadian border at Niagara Falls safe and sound.</description>

This time it was “Nueve y Nueve Bistro”, a wonderful Hacienda renovated and modernized (Casa Lamm), which is not only a restaurant but also hosts several art galleries. I had delicious local fare, but I can not remember the names, so look at the pictures and enjoy 😉</description>

      <description>My wonderful wife invited me to the inaugural cruise of the Quantum of the Seas, which sailed from New York (actually, New Jersey, across the river) and into the Atlantic Ocean, November 18-21.
I love those “inaugurals”. Although their official destination is “nowhere”, I get to enjoy the ship, with its restaurants, and entertainment, in just 3 days. Of course I prefer full cruises (and next April we are taking a very awesome one), but right now I can’t be away from cell coverage and internet for more than 3 days, so this is perfect.</description>

We had fun meeting the family (although my parents were on a cruise), projecting movies at night on the “large screen” over the living room windows, and playing all kinds of games.</description>

      <description>November 13th I took another early flight to London. It was very sad to miss the breakfast at the Sofitel in Warsaw, because they are usually quite good. But at 4am no hotel has the breakfast buffet open.
I also slept like a baby on my flight to London.
When I arrived in the hotel, the nice Regency, near Hyde Park, it was cold and raining. They did not have my room ready, and would not have it until 14:00h, although they let me know that I would receive a complementary upgrade to a “triple room with a balcony”.</description>

      <description>The next morning, November 12, my flight to Warsaw was not only very early, but also departing from Frankfurt. And it is not fun to get up really early to try to beat the traffic, and the clock, in the Autobahn. I heard that you won’t really get a speeding ticket in the Autobahn. I sure as heck hope that is true, because I broke my speed record in a utility vehicle (my experience with supercars in closed circuits don’t count).</description>

      <description>November 6, after an online demo to a customer in Colombia, a follow up call with business partners in London, and a call with some Swiss investors, I flew to Vienna.
150mph (240kmh) tail winds allowed us to arrive 40 minutes early, which is usually a good thing. But not always. “Red eye” flights are all night flights in which the best thing you can do is sleep. It’s not easy to sleep on a plane, with service and people going up and down, announcements, lights, and crying babies.</description>

      <description>On Monday November 3rd, right after a call with a Frost &amp;amp; Sullivan analyst, I was invited to the seminar “Spain: Global Platform for International Business Investment”. The event took place in the evening at Jones Day’s headquarters. The usual suspects were there, all in their dark suits and ties. The usual message was there too “Spain is a great place to invest, the government has taken the right steps and now things are finally looking up”.</description>

      <description>LIMA October 26-30
After the nice weekend in New York I met with my friend and workmate Alvaro in Lima.
Following the advice of our friend Jose Carlos, who lives there, we stayed at the NM Lima Hotel, and it was the right choice, with a great quality / price and location. Perhaps the modern decor does not always work, but it`s nice the effort they have put into it. Although Halloween was just around the corner, the fake spider net in the lift required us to bend down every time we used it.</description>

      <description>Between my trip to Mexico and the next one to Peru and Colombia, I spent a weekend in New York, and took the opportunity to go with my wife and her ex-husband to see &amp;ldquo;Kontakthof&amp;rdquo; by Pina Bausch dance company at the Howard Gilman Opera House Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM).
Before the show we went to a South African restaurant in Brooklyn called Madiba. Interesting mix of flavors and decor, great seafood imported directly from Mozambique, rustic atmosphere and somewhat &amp;ldquo;hipster&amp;rdquo; but not too much despite being in Brooklyn.</description>

      <description>Due to the launch of the biosensors module for my company`s medical imaging and data solution a few days ago, the Withings company sent me a biosensor (wearable) Withings Pulse Ox, manometer BPM and WiFi WS-30 scale for testing and integration tests ahead of some national projects we are about to sign in London and Santiago de Chile.
All three came in luxury packaging, and were relatively easy to connect and set up, at least for a &amp;ldquo;tinkerer&amp;rdquo; (there are people who gets annoyed if I use &amp;ldquo;hacker&amp;rdquo; as a synonym, although it is) like me.</description>

      <description>After such a nice weekend, I returned to my usual travel pace. This time the first stop was Mexico.
My friends, in addition to distributors, &amp;ldquo;the Germinales&amp;rdquo; (three generations with the same name), treated me extremely well, inviting me to great restaurants, and taking care of everything from transportation to bills. It is a pleasure doing business with them because they understand the human aspect which we often tend to forget, including myself.</description>

      <description>Three weeks ago I enjoyed a nice week at home in New York. My in-laws came to visit from Canada, and my wife took the opportunity to try new recipes using some very fresh ingredients bought in the weekend-only Farmer`s Market just around the corner, on 23rd st in Chelsea. Despite being small, they seem to carry everything, even &amp;ldquo;tea champagne&amp;rdquo; (fermented kombucha with ginger).
From polenta with swiss chards and mushrooms, to homemade apple pie (New Yorkers know their apples: whenever you can, try the &amp;ldquo;honey crisp&amp;rdquo;, you wont regret it), its a real pleasure to enjoy such delicious and healthy dishes.</description>

      <description>I have just bought a OnePlusOne phone, and have been using it for a couple of days. Let me tell you: it`s AMAZING.
If you have never heard of the company, dont worry, youre not alone. But you should definitely check it out, because their phones are incredibly high quality, high specs, and low price (mine was $349). No catch:
 Qualcomm© Snapdragon™ 801 processor with 2.5GHz Quad-core CPUs Adreno 330 GPU, 578MHz 64 GB eMMC 5.</description>

      <description>Last Thursday I met with executives from Dell in the Dell Solution Center in New York to explore potential collaborations between my company and Dell.
Funny how large companies have adopted this system of offices / &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; centers to make presentations to clients spread across major cities in the world. With telecommuting gaining ground but face to face still being something fundamental in business, it makes much more sense than it seems.</description>

Located at 200 Park Avenue, NY – Met Life building, floor 52 (if I remember correctly) the views were outstanding.
It was definitely a “business attire” reception, with everyone wearing a suit, and only a couple of us “daring” not to wear a tie.</description>

      <description>I was in Lisbon, London, Valencia, and Paris for a day each last week, including flights, and meetings, so too short for individual long blog posts… or even picture galleries!
Some of the anecdotes in those trips:
– My flight to Lisbon was delayed 2:05h. The airline, TAP-Portugalia, tried really hard to departure 1:55h late at most, since after two hours delay they have to compensate passengers monetarily. But they couldn’t make it.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago I was at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. Of course, when I arrive in an airport with enough time ahead of my boarding, I look for a plug and wifi. Luckily Schiphol is an excellent airport, offering both. The only problem is that every time I clicked on the &amp;ldquo;Enjoy unlimited free wifi – Connect&amp;rdquo; button, I got an &amp;ldquo;Unknown error 0&amp;rdquo; message back.
 Don`t tell me &amp;ldquo;Enjoy unlimited free wifi&amp;rdquo; and then try to prevent me from accessing it.</description>

      <description>As soon as I arrived in Utrecht, Diederik took me to a lunch at a very nice restaurant, inside an industrial complex: Zuiver. Both him and the waiter suggested the smoked eel salad, and I must agree, it was delicious.
Then, after a couple of very interesting meetings, he took me to dinner to another very nice restaurant, this time in the colorful and very touristy Red Light District: ANNA, where we had pre-appetizer, appetizer, main course, pre-dessert, and dessert.</description>

      <description>On Monday September 15 I flew from New York to Milan, and went straight to a business meeting. From there I took the train to Rome. Although I was quite tired upon arrival, I had to stay awake until it was “local time to go to bed” to avoid jet-lag, so I took a stroll through the Piazza della Repubblica, where I had a Panini di melanzana e mozzarella, and Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore, where I had a Gelato di canoli (yes, canoli flavor, not a canoli).</description>

      <description>So much traveling, flying, walking, sitting and time zone changes make your body ache, so some exercise is absolutely necessary. In my case, I try to book hotels with swimming pool, so I can swim. In the case of Singapore, given the year round mild climate, I felt like swimming in the outdoors swimming pool to start my third day.
I spent most of the day working, meeting with potential customers.</description>

It wasn’t easy to get there, because the Formula 1 preparations had many streets closed to pedestrians, so I had to navigate my way around a maze of hotels and shopping malls. In one of them, the Marina Square, I saw a Mr.</description>

But one can’t help to associate Singapore with high rises, luxury, order and cleanliness brought about by strict laws. As I was about to find out, there is plenty of all that, and reasons for it, but Singapore is also much more than that.</description>

But somehow I did not take into account the “international day line”, so I kept checking the time right… but not the date!</description>

During the flight from Newark to Narita there were many movies available in the personal entertainment system, some quite appealing since I would not easily have access to them; movies like a selection from Tribeca Film Festival, Bolt from the Blue, Genome Hazard, Horseplay, Samurai Hustle, The Monkey King, The Snow White Murder Case, or TV shows like Hanasaki Mai Speaks Out, Happy Camp, Secret Series, Tasty Road, Treasures of the Country… but I had access to electrical current outlet plug, so I slept 4 hours and worked on my laptop for 9 hours straight, with “Creep” by Radiohead playing in single repeat mode.</description>

In this case we chose Colombian contemporary artist Carlos Motta: &amp;ldquo;Brief history of US Interventions in Latin America since 1946, 2005/14&amp;rdquo; (Guggenheim UBS MAP Purchase Fund 2014.39).
It is part of a series produced by Carlos Motta between 2005 and 2009 that present two chronologies of events in Latin America: one of U.S. interventions in the region since 1946, and one of the areas leftist guerrilla movements.</description>

Its amazing that in the XXI century bureaucracy affects so many countries so much, and toy with peoples lives via ridiculous laws.
The official information handled by my travel agency, one of the largest in the world, says that if I spend less than 24 hours in India I do not need visa.</description>

The show ironically took place in the old 21st police Precinct (327 East 22nd Street) which, from 1863 and for 50 years was notorious for corruption and brutality in a [formerly]seedy part of town.
Curated by Robert Aloia &amp;amp; VNA Mag, it featured Adam Dare, Al Diaz, Amanda Marie, ASVP, Bad Pedestrian, Ben Angotti , Bill Claps, Bishop203, Bunny M.</description>

It was also a great opportunity to see NY from the eyes of a tourist again, which I sometimes fail to do since I have been living here for 3 years now.
There are a ton of anecdotes and discoveries behind these pictures, but you have to come to New York to experience them 😉</description>

      <description>Back in New York the first thing I did was&amp;hellip; leave again. A quick business trip to Atlanta followed back to back by a trip to Houston.
Both trips and meetings went well, and the team of professionals in those meetings were, dare I say, the top in their respective fields in the world. It was a work-related pleasure.
But the one thing I will remember the most from those trips, even more than the delicious upscale Hugo`s Mexican restaurantin Houston, will be the black swans I met at the very nice Omni Houston Hotel.</description>

      <description>I admit it, there are still great restaurants in Valencia that I have not tried yet. But I am on a mission to change that.
While Samsharemains my all-time favorite despite its location, before we flew back to New York we tried the Michelin Guide starred Poblet restaurant.
I shouldnt be surprised, since I ate at Quique Dacostas El Poblet in Denia a few years ago and knew he was onto something.</description>

      <description>The last week of July and first two weeks of August my wife and I were in Valencia with the kids. What a wonderful summer!
Seeing my son brave the waves to slide into the Mediterranean sea from a high boat slide, my daughter ride her horse into the sunset, or enjoying movies on a big screen in our terrace overlooking the sea and the city, were memories that I will cherish forever.</description>

      <description>After the cruise my wife and I took our American relatives to Barcelona for 3 days. Nothing new for me there except the Sagrada Familia (yes, its true: after countless trips to Barcelona, I had never visited the amazing architectural wonder), although there are some things I can never get tired of, like Gaudis architecture, or Picasso`s museum.
Staying at the convenient and elegant Hotel España, next to the Liceu, was a great idea, made even better by their Martín Berasategui`s restaurant Fonda.</description>

      <description>The day at Palma was very nice. We strolled through town, enjoying the Cathedral`s altars (by Gaudiand Barceló), the typical architecture, tried some sobrasada, bought some ensaimada, and went back to the ship feeling at home. After all, I spent many summers in nearby Ibiza and visited Mallorca many times.</description>

      <description>Knowing that the organized excursion to Tunisia was going to be exhausting, the kids did not come with us, so we had plenty of time to explore La Goulette, Sidi Bou Saïd, and the National Bardo Museum.
There is no doubt Sidi Bou Saïd is picturesque and nice to visit. Clearly Mediterranean in its colors and folklore, it reminds you of the Greek islands or even Ibiza (the old twon).</description>

      <description>My visit to Palermo was a brief one, because there is not much of interest for the kids and in any way I prefer the North of Italy to the South: climate, personality, food, culture&amp;hellip; so we disembarked, were incessantly approached and solicited by local &amp;ldquo;tour guides&amp;rdquo; and other merchants as you would expect in the North of Africa, took a walk – fortunately the seaport is near the city center – and went back to the ship.</description>

      <description>On day 3 of our cruise we stopped in Civitavecchia (Rome).
As a thank you gift to my parents, we had arranged three private minivans with bilingual guides, that picked us up in Civitavecchia and took us to Rome.
Much has been written about Rome, with so many archeological remains, and art, combined with a very lively city life and character.
We did not have much time and the group was large, including kids and a person in a wheelchair, so we started at the Spanish Steps, and went to Villa Borghese, one of Romes most famous parks, right above Piazza del Popolo.</description>

After a short cab ride to the city center from the seaport, we explored its very eclectic cathedral, an old crumbling palazzo turn into antiques store, beautiful arched galleries and narrow streets.</description>

      <description>This summer, for my mother`s birthday, my father invited the whole family (on both sides of the Atlantic) to a 7 night Mediterranean cruise from July 10 to July 17 onboard the MSC Musica. Thank you dad!
We boarded in Valencia (Spain), and stopped in Marseille (France), Genoa, Rome, and Palermo (Italy), La Goulette (Tunisia), and Palma de Mallorca (Spain), before returning back to Valencia.
Although the ship is a mass market one (you could tell looking at the food, entertainment, and passengers), it was quite nice.</description>

Just attach some velcro to the back of a Lego, attach it to the edge of your desk, get some of your favorite figures, have them &amp;ldquo;hold their arms up&amp;rdquo;, and let them hold the USB and charger cables for you 🙂</description>

      <description>Wednesday was a long day.
First I was invited to a VIP breakfast executive briefing and presentation by IBM at 7:45am. The event, in which IBM showcased their Watson technology and three partner companies talked about how they are leveraging NLP capabilities, lasted until 12:30pm, but I stayed for an extra hour for a meeting with an IBM executive.
Then I headed back to the office for 3 conference calls. By 7:00pm I was ready to go to the Social Radar startup launch party Stephanie and I had been invited to.</description>

      <description>A friend got me a VIP pass for the 2014 Scope Basel Art Show(thank you, Jorge!). I had it all planned out: since I had a meeting in Stuttgart the day before, I could drive to nearby Basel, attend the VIP opening, and then fly back to New York. But the Stuttgart meeting was cancelled, so I changed my plane ticket, and returned to New York in time to go to the Amos Lee concert in Brooklyn`s Prospect Parkwith my wife.</description>

      <description>After a weekend in Valencia, last Monday I went to Madrid. Awesome high speed train from Valencia in the morning, business presentation, and a delicious Japanese lunch at Kabukiwith my friends Juan and Alvaro. So good was the lunch and company that I almost missed my flight. It did not help that I went to Terminal 4 as usual, when my flight to London departed from Terminal 1, and in the Adolfo Suarez Madrid Barajas airport, it takes a long time to go from terminal to terminal.</description>

      <description>Last Thursday I arrived in Nice just in time to catch a very nice and expensive taxi (al least they are almost all brand new and very clean Mercedes Benz cars) that took me to the IBM Client Center in nearby La Gaude for my first IBM European Cloud Advisory Board meeting.
It was an interesting meeting, attended by 15 business executives, investors and analysts. Not only they were all very smart, but I was brain dead after the long red-eye flight.</description>

      <description>Last Wednesday I participated in IBM’s Federal Summit at the Ronald Reagan Federal Building in Washington DC.
Business aside, it was one scary meeting. There were control systems all over. From the IRS to airports, to National Security, the demos were much more advanced and comprehensive than anything you may have seen in a movie. Big Brother to the Nth degree. They know it all about you. In a second. You either get paranoid-serious about security, encryption and privacy, or you might as well forget completely about your privacy.</description>

      <description>Last week, although I had torn the ligaments on my right ankle, I travelled on a quick trip to South America for business.
After a 12 hour flight I arrived early in the morning in Santiago de Chile and had to go straight to a business meeting because the hotel did not have my room available and check-in time was 2:00pm. What was worse: when I finally made it back to the hotel, after a full day of flying and another full day of work, I had to stand hammers banging on the wall until after midnight.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I started learning and experimenting with quantum computing programming. Its not easy to express the fun and excitement that experience brought me, but Ill try:
Programming a quantum computer is different than programming a binary (0 and 1) &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; computer. To program a quantum system, you have to map a problem into a search for the “lowest point&amp;rdquo; in a very large pool of options, which corresponds to the best possible outcome.</description>

It turned out to be a spectacular evening. The vessel was filled with celebrities: military, politicians with their secret service bodyguards, diplomats, sports, business and entertainment people.</description>

 Since the early 1990s, Althamer (b. 1967 Warsaw, Poland) has established a unique artistic practice featuring an expanded approach to sculptural representation and consistently experimental models of social collaboration.
 It was great to discuss with a museum curator which piece to select (we agreed without a doubt), and it`s a pleasure to have this piece in the living room of our Chelsea apartment.</description>

In Barcelona I participated in the II Emergence Forum by Transbio Sudoe, a gathering of academics, companies &amp;amp; technological platforms from Spain, France, Portugal with the objective of setting up collaborative projects. I gave a lecture and participated in an expert panel.
The event allowed me to meet very interesting people, and visiting the Barcelona Supercomputing Center(with its Mare Nostrum supercomputer, in the most amazing set-up you could even imagine) and the Barcelona Scientific Park.</description>

Besides the interesting new features (here are the videos), and the delicious and healthy lunch buffet, I networked quite a lot, and had a few laughs about the highest concentration of Google Glasses per person I have seen so far. One thing is clear: genomics, which is one of the main things my two companies deal with, and the cloud, are closely related, and they will be even more in the near future.</description>

      <description>Since I have been a few weeks without being able to post anything for several reasons (health, family, work, blog migration&amp;hellip;), I am going to catch up &amp;ldquo;all at once&amp;rdquo;, writing in a couple of posts two month`s worth of activity.
February 23 to 26 my wife and I attended the healthcare tech trade show HIMSS, in Orlando, FL (USA).
We got a huge room at the Marriott Royal Palms, but we could not enjoy the city much due to work.</description>

      <description>Actually, a couple people told me &amp;ldquo;Whats up with your blog? you havent posted anything for ages, and the categories are broken&amp;rdquo;. But other than that, nobody noticed, or cared, or both. Which is weird because on the other hand, my Google+ page is about to hit a million visits, and my LinkedIn profile is in the top 5%&amp;hellip; :S
Oh, well. The truth is, the blog was indeed messed up because of a quick server migration, and I had not posted anything in a long time because I am insanely busy.</description>

      <description>My wife and I were invited to the inaugural cruise for the Norwegian Getaway. A &amp;ldquo;sister ship&amp;rdquo; to the Norwegian Breakaway, in which inaugural we cruised last year, this ship is almost exactly identical. We enjoyed fine dining at Le Bistro, Taste, and The Tropicana, cocktails and music at Bliss, and particularly entertainment:
 Comedian Ralph Harrisat the Headliners Comedy Club  Burn the Floorthe musical Illusionarium, a pretty good steam-punk themed magic show with dinner Buddy Valastro (Cake Boss) live cake decorating session  The return to port and docking gave us a nice view of Manhattan`s skyline, along with the scary view of the Hudson river with big chunks of ice (locals say that was unseen since 1977).</description>

      <description>On Wednesday January 8th I was asked to hold a meeting regarding the potential involvement of my company (Kanteron Systems) in IBM’s Watson. It was a late night meeting, on the 54th floor of the still under construction World Trade Center. The reason why the meeting took place there is because the IBM team was finishing the set up of the next day’s Watson presentation.
What is Watson, you may ask?</description>

      <description>We spent this Christmas in Spain (Valencia and Malaga) with family and friends.
When you drive next to the Mediterranean sea to go to the office, and see a breathtaking sunrise while you refill your car`s gas tank, work does not seem such a drag. As usual, the highlight was food. In particular, in Valencia the always superb Samsha Restaurant(probably my favorite in the world, with chef Victor Rodrigo, winner of the Chef of the Year Award in Spain), the surprisingly good tapas of Picoteo de Vicio(thanks for the recommendation, Eugenia), and the dramatically palatial setting of La Embajada.</description>

      <description>I have been twice at the Madison Square Garden recently. The first time around I was invited, along with my wife, to an NBA New York Knicks vs San Antonio Spurs game. Great seats, we enjoyed the show (since the game was pretty lame). It amazed me how many food stands (from hot dogs to sushi), souvenirs, and paraphernalia stalls there were. Even the popcorn basket had the Knicks logo on it.</description>

      <description>I use qtranslate as a multi-language plugin for my blog. It`s an excellent solution, but the problem is that everytime Word Press is updated, it takes days, and sometimes weeeks, for the plugin author to update it.
So, tired of waiting, I have found a quick and simple hack to make it work with the latests WP 3.8 update: edit qtranslate.php to
 define(‘QT_SUPPORTED_WP_VERSION, ‘3.8);
 You`re welcome 😉</description>

      <description>Cold men destroy women,” my mother wrote me years later. “They woo them with something personable that they bring out for show, something annexed to their souls like a fake greenhouse, lead you in, and you think you see life and vitality and sun and greenness, and then when you love them, they lead you out into their real soul, a drafty, cavernous, empty ballroom, inexorably arched and vaulted and mocking you with its echoes— you hear all you have sacrificed, all you have given, landing with a loud clunk.</description>

From the 6th to the 8th I was back in Montevideo(Uruguay) for business. Taking an all-night flight there (via Miami) to minimize time away, my time there was very productive, packed with interesting business meetings and presentations. It was worth the 5,339 miles.
I was lucky to meet with some very interesting doctors and executives, and to try some good restaurants (like Dueto and La Perdiz), although I added many more (Estancia del Puerto, Arcadia, Estrecho, Wasa, Sucre Sale, Raffi, Cafe Bar Tavare, and Rara Avis) to my list, since I am sure I will be back soon.</description>

It was pure summer fun, from the food (including of course noodle paella &amp;ldquo;fideuá&amp;rdquo; with crayfish, and classic paella), to the beach and swimming pool (Valencia, Moraira with a million childhood memories of one of the best beaches in the Mediterranean, El Puig&amp;hellip;), we enjoyed non-stop with the kids playing hide and seek, building sand castles, programming videogames, setting up a large screen &amp;ldquo;cinema&amp;rdquo; to watch cartoons, going to the Science Museumand Aquarium, and even doing homework.</description>

 I’d like to offer you the opportunity to author an article which we would look to promote across all of our social properties, other external communications as well as our paid media sponsorships, i.e. blogs.
 I was given suggestions on article length, topic, and keywords, but freedom to write whatever I wanted.</description>

      <description>In a single word: security.
By now there is no doubt about the advantages of the cloud: easy collaboration, scalability, ubiquity, sync, cost savings (21% on average, according to AFCOM 2011, 40% according to our own customers), rapid deployment, etc.
There is also no doubt about the need for a move to the cloud in healthcare: according to Enterprise Strategy Group, by 2015 an average of 665TB of data will be generated per hospital per year.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday August 13th (in case you did not notice, I am obviously not superstitious at all), I took a &amp;ldquo;red-eye&amp;rdquo; (so called because you arrive with red eyes) flight to Lima, Peru. Note to self number one: do not take one of the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; taxis with a desk before the exit of the controlled area of the airport. $46 for a ride to downtown is a steal, no matter how luxurious and comfortable the car.</description>

      <description>We got great gifts for our wedding, but hands down, the best (ever!) is A ROBOT.
My mother-in-law got us a robot. Got that? How cool is that!?
And it is not to make her daughter’s life easier, because I am the one who vacuums at home. She did it because it is cool. Heck yeah it is!
So the Roombais nothing new. It has been around for a decade already.</description>

      <description>We were originally planning on getting married in Valencia (Spain). Bureaucracy made it too hard. So we decided to change our plans, and get married were we got engaged: Niagara Falls!
[Nevertheless, we will still hold a wedding party in Valencia (Spain) for friends and family, at the Westin Hotel, as it was originally planned, but during the last weekend of August]
We flew from New York to Buffalo Thursday, August 1st, at night and drove to my in-laws across the Canada border to spend the night.</description>

The Festival Opening Film, with Introduction and Q&amp;amp;A with Director Toshiaki Toyoda, and after film party. Interesting story about death, life, cults&amp;hellip;

MÖBIUS – a Danish design classic. We bought it at Georg Jensen– 687 Madison Ave., NY.
 The MÖBIUS ring is inspired by geometry, a magnificent example of post-modern innovation. In math, a MÖBIUS is a shape with one surface and one edge (boundary). It is a fluid, infinite shape that inspires reflection.</description>

The good weather means more outdoors. In NYC it means more &amp;ldquo;city&amp;rdquo;, but also &amp;ldquo;more things going on in the city&amp;rdquo;.
This weekend we have walked a lot, and seen quite a few interesting things around town (caveat: I am no expert in NY, although Spanish newspaper Expansion interviewed meabout it last week), like:
 A Chinese-Spanish cuisine restaurant (no, I have no desire to try it any time soon; there are many others higher on my list) Yoga in Bryant Park A looooooong line of police cars going by The Orly Genger art installation at Madison Sq.</description>

 Then, today (4th of July) I went to a protest to demand the restoration of the Fourth Amendment:

On Thursday our friend Marsha invited us to attend the Garden City Hotel Gilded Revelry event: reopening of Grand Ballroom.
At first it did not seem that interesting, specially taking into account that we had to ride the LIRR train for 40 minutes from Penn Station (changing in Jamaica) to Long Island. But once we arrived, we quickly admitted it was a good idea.
A renovated Grand Ballroom hosting two acrobats, an electric violin and a DJ with projections of historic photos from the hotel in the background for entertaining, and the real highlight of the night: the most amazing sushi bar I have ever had the pleasure to experience on one side, and an awesome and delicious hors d`oeuvres buffet on the other.</description>

All things must come to an end, and this amazing trip did too. We disembarked in Seward early, following an easy and relaxed procedure, finding our luggage right away, and boarding the transfer service that would drive us to Anchorage for the next three hours. But on the way we made a few “last stops” where we saw black and brown bears, moose, lynxes, oxen, elks, rain deers, bisons, eagles, owls…</description>

Before breakfast, we woke up to the sound of the ship’s hull breaking ice plaques in the water. The captain warned us that we were sailing next to Hubbard Glacier, so we got dressed in a hurry and ran to the observation deck (level 12). The glaciers were spectacular. Amazing. Breathtaking. And any other similar adjectives you can think of.
Their intense blue is due to the way they are formed: layers upon layers of heavy snow compresses the bottom, squeezing any tiny bubble of air out, until only pure ice crystals remain, glacier crystals, which are intense and beautiful blue.</description>

As if we had not experienced enough adventure and beauty, Sitka was awaiting us with even more. Early in the morning, after an in-room breakfast, we boarded the St. Michael catamaran to go on a wild life quest between the narrow island passages and open bays of the Sitka Sound, with the dormant volcano Mount Edgecumbe providing an unsurpassable background to one of the world`s most beautiful coastal environments.</description>

Caviar on warm blinis and Montaudon champagne for breakfast, while docking in Skagway. That is the right way to start an amazing day. As soon as we finished our breakfast, we disembarked right in front of the “graffiti” that cruise lines have been painting on the mountain (with their logos, captain and vessel names) since 1928, and went to the heliport to board a Eurocopter that took us, through narrow canyons and spectacular valleys, flying over very high peaks and several glaciers, to the dog camp on the Denver Glacier.</description>

June 15 we woke up in Juneau, Alaska’s capital (the largest and best known city is Anchorage, but Juneau is the official capital).
After breakfast, we attended a very rare screening of a 7 minute animation film called “Destino”, a little known collaboration between Salvador Dali and Walt Disney started in 1949, but unfinished until 2007 when Roy Disney decided to hire a team of French animators to complete it.</description>

We woke up in Ketchikan, Alaska’s fourth largest city with 14,000 inhabitants, which almost gets doubled by today’s visitors (via 4 cruise ships): 10,000 cruisers.
As is the case in many communities around Alaska, things are spread out between many little islands. So, for example, Ketchikan has an airport in which a 747 can land… but the luggage has to be picked up in another island, accessible by ferry, because the “airport island” is too little to have both the landing strip and the luggage collection area.</description>

We decided to sleep in to recuperate from a very active week, so we ordered the breakfast in the room. While not a friend of in-room service, everything (muesli, wheat meal, blueberry pancakes, cheese omelette, smoked salmon bagel, fresh pineapple) was perfect. The restaurant schedules are very “American”, with breakfast served until 10:00am, lunch until 1:30pm, and dinner only until 9:30pm!
We spent the whole day at sea, cruising North through the Inside Passage.</description>

On Tuesday, June 11, and not believing that it had not rained on our trip yet, we asked the hotel for a couple of complimentary bicycles and were told that only one was available but the other one should be available soon. So in the meantime we took the aquabus from the foot of Davie Street in Yaletown to the Public Market on Granville Island, False Creek, where a former industrial site was long ago converted into an indoor public market.</description>

On Monday we spent the whole day in Grouse Mountain.
Getting there is not difficult, but it could definitely be simpler. First we walked up Granville, where we passed a medical marihuana dispensary (“Victorian Pharmacy”), to Canada Place, where we bought the tickets at the tourist office assisted by a very nice old lady. From there we walked to Waterfront Station where we took the SeaBus to North Vancouver. Then the 236 bus at dock 8, that took us all the way up to Grouse Mountain, stopping at several cute residential streets, including Cortell street!</description>

A very early flight allowed us to see the sunrise over Manhattan’s skyline, perfectly delineated as if drawn by an architect, from Newark Airport.
In Vancouver’s airport they take their indigenous art seriously, with large wood figures and totem poles all over. There you also realize how much of a cruise city it is: cruise lines have their own counters at the airport, to take passengers and luggage directly to their ship.</description>

      <description>On May 13th, on my way to a friends apartment, we stumbled upon the set of Ben Stillers new movie right outside the 125th St. subway exit. They were filming in the middle of the street. What struck me the most was that one of the façades of the building had been completely redone (cast, cement, wood, paint&amp;hellip; it looked absolutely real and solid) for the film.
Really? No building façade will do?</description>

Friday May 17th I took the day to meet some of the interesting tech companies present in New York. There are over 1,200 tech companies in NY(including CodeAcademy, KickStarter, Foursquare, MakerBot, ZocDoc, Guilt, AppNexus, Tumblr, Etsy, KickStarter, Automatic&amp;hellip; and mine!), most between the Flat Iron and SoHo areas of Manhattan (Silicon ALley). So I chose a few that, for one reason or another, I was interested in meeting and talk to their founders.</description>

On Sunday, after returning to New York from the inaugural cruise, we went to Central Park to spend the afternoon and enjoy Japan Day!
Tents with huge lines to get free Japanese food (udon, okonomiyaki, gyozas, panda chocolate snacks, tea&amp;hellip;), activities (calligraphy, kimonos, origami, yoyo-fishing&amp;hellip;) and performances (karate, taiko&amp;hellip;), all very well organized and full of mostly Japanese people in a very fun and nice event.
There were even so many cosplayers that it reminded me of Jing?</description>

All things must come to an end, so today we sadly had to disembark. After a nice breakfast and a last stroll through the ship, we disembarked very fast and easily, and in a few minutes we were back home in Chelsea (after going through the most absurd and disorganized taxi system I have seen in this country).
What`s my verdict? It is an exceptionally nice ship for a mass market, even considering its gigantic size.</description>

Day 2 of our cruise started waking up to the sound of the waves and with a buffet breakfast at Garden Café, which we took in an outside table.
The day was fully packed of activities, and given my terrible memory, I`m sure I would have forgotten some of them by now. But thanks to the fact that the cruise line gave us access to the net (although only for Twitter, Facebook and Instagram), I was able to tweet my activities, and then use the TL to remember them easier.</description>

We were invited to board the Norwegian Breakaway inauguralcruise last Friday. A huge (146,600 tones and 1,062 feet for 4,000 passengers and 1,595 crew) and brand new ship.
It was a short inaugural cruise, 100 miles into the Atlantic Ocean, for VIPs (the bankers that financed the construction of the ship, Norwegian Cruise Lines executives, journalists, &amp;ldquo;star&amp;rdquo; travel agents&amp;hellip; even Mayor Bloomberg). Many well known people aboard: artist Peter Max, who designed the hull and was signing posters, Iron Chef Geoffrey Zakarian (with his Ocean Blue restaurant as one of the 27 the ship has)&amp;hellip; As we went through the very fast and easy boarding procedure at Pier 88, even President Obama flew over the ship in his helicopter!</description>

      <description>One of the friends having dinner with us yesterdaywas a lawyer that used to be a Public Defender in NY. Of all the many interesting stories she had to tell, one struck me as the perfect example of all that is wrong with The System.
 Once she had to defend a homeless man who was accused of stealing a candy bar from a drugstore. Since he had breached a non-trespass order from a previous similar incident, the prosecutor was asking for a 3 year prison sentence.</description>

Yesterday we joined a few friends in part of the NY Shorewalkers The Great Saunter 2013walk. While the Shorewalkers started early in the morning and walked all along the West side of Manhattan, we started much later, and to the subway to Carl Schurz Park, where we had fun watching the dogs at the dog park, visiting Major Bloomberg`s official residence (although he does not really live there, he only uses it as a nice reception place), enjoying the trees blooming and flowers, and strolling up the East side to meet them half way.</description>

      <description>If I go to the office, I complain that there are too many distractions: whether it is the boom-boom music form the downstairs SoHo store, my coworkers playing ping-pong, street art that requires my attention, or the temptation of a Japanese bento box or mochi with tea&amp;hellip;
But if I stay at home, Calvin makes sure I am not as productive as I could be.
OK, I admit it, this was a very silly excuse to try a new slider plugin with Pinterest non-official API&amp;hellip; and trying those things is not a diversion or distraction, is part of my job, I swear!</description>

So we ordered the test kit online, and when we entered the state (NY), a big warning told us that according to state laws, we could not produce or mail the samples back to their labs from New York. WTF?! OK, whatever. As if a nonsensical law did not have many ways around it.</description>

After London and Oxford, to finish a great birthday weekend, we went to Valencia (Spain).
We visited family and friends (the whole purpose of the trip) including the studio of Claudio Zirotti, went to the office to work more than we wanted to, chose wedding venue, and as always, had a lot of rice dishes.
The anecdote of the trip was on the way out. Once in Madrid, before boarding the Madrid-New York Iberia flight, the &amp;ldquo;extra security&amp;rdquo; at the gate asked me if I had a flight ticket back to Spain.</description>

So we flew from New York to London, departing on Friday night, arriving Saturday morning. We went straight to the amazing Bvlgari hotel, and after a tour of the hotel by the director, I found a very nice and delicious birthday cake (and some truffles) in our room.
The room was perfect.</description>

Today we have gone to the Independentart show at Center 548. Two floors (starts in the second floor, and the roof top only has a bar). The second floor has some, very few, interesting works. The third floor? Don`t even bother. From childish to improvised, without even being outsider or brut.
When I go to art shows like this I exit with a strange happy grin. The reason? I realize I still have a personal taste, and I know what I don`t like, no matter how crowded the space is, or if it is in Chelsea.</description>

Yesterday we were invited by Miwako Tezuka (domo arigato!) to the inauguration of Edo Popat Japan Society. It was wonderful!
Besides the classic and beautiful nishiki-e works by the masters Katsushika Hokusai (yes, Under the Wave off Kanagawa from the series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, was there), Utagawa Hiroshige, Toshusai Sharaku, Toyota Hokkei, Utagawa Kunisada, Utagawa Kuniyoshi, and Suzuki Harunobu, there were contemporary works by graffiti artist Aiko, strikingly &amp;ldquo;Japanese&amp;rdquo; transparencies by Emily Allchurch, reinterpreted iconic portraits by Paul Binnie, political criticism in the work of Ishii Toru and Kazama Sachiko (amazing the large format Alas!</description>

On Thursday I woke up to a message from a friend, professor at MIT, who was flying to SXSW and was stuck onboard the plane with the Boston airport closed. We had a freak snow storm: it started snowing in the morning. The snow accumulated throughout the day. By night it stopped and temperatures went up. In two days we have gone from 20ºF to 54ºF. New York weather: unpredictable and not for the faint of heart 😉</description>

A couple days ago we were invited to the inauguration of Moving Imagecontemporary video art fair at the Terminal Stores (Waterfront Tunnel).
Interesting initiative, in a spectacular space, but as always some works were more appealing than others. This time, without a doubt, the only ones that I would definitely recommend are the ones shown by Ted Victoria(represented by Schröder Romero &amp;amp; Shredder). Very objectual, but quite imaginative and evocative.</description>

Luckily, these events are getting better and better with their online access and info, and now we have Volta‘s catalogue online:We also have a good portion of Armory‘s show online, by Artsy.
Enjoy 😉</description>

      <description>Business took me again to Panama on Monday, for a quick trip (two days).
Tin roofed huts with satellite TV next to high rise office buildings, riding on an official (with sirens) tinted window SUV with driver and no license plates, and staying in a nice hotelthat was not extraordinary but had all and everything that I look for in a hotel (except indoors swimming pool). But it belongs to the friend (former Treasury Secretary) of a friend.</description>

I dont like Las Vegas, too flashy, too empty, too superficial... but every time I go, I end up with interesting experiences and observations. Like the devastating effect extreme market capitalism can have on the credibility of institutions (Judge Judys branded slot machine?? WTF!!).</description>

      <description>February 9th was truly a day of wine and snow.
A big snowfall came down the night before, leaving the pretty pictures we have all seen in the media, along with 6,000 cancelled flights and 400,000 homes without power in the Boston area.
So I had no plans to get out of my comfortable Chelsea apartment, but Jill (a friend who works at the New York Times, and who is moving to Washington DC to head the DC Bureau of the NYT) invited us to the NYC Winter Wine Fest.</description>

      <description>After MIT`s crazy week, back in NY I needed a couple of days of sleep and relax to get back into the normal rhythm. Luckily it was SuperBowl weekend, so the streets (and Chelsea Market) were fairly empty!
So on Tuesday I was ready to get going full speed ahead. First, after meeting with P. Oberton in the NYPL, then I went to Condé Nast publications` building, into Wired Magazine, to discuss a PR campaign/project along with Valencia Regional Minister of Industry (&amp;amp; etc) Max Buch.</description>

My team (team senZa) choose me to do the presentation of the teams project. We all thought we did an excellent job, and everybody in the room (372) congratulated us. One of the judges even said &amp;quot;it is the best one I have ever seen&amp;quot;. But... lo and behold, we were not selected to the final round. And whats even worst, we received almost no feedback.</description>

After that, lectures by William Aulet, Scott Keating, Paul Maeder, and Antoinette Schoar.
And then&amp;hellip; an all-nighter preparing the group project. Tension, stress, frustration, but in the end a great feeling of accomplishment, and pride in a job well done.</description>

      <description>Day 4 started with a corporate presentation (we got to choose, and I attended the one by Pfizer) at 7:30am, in which Pfizer`s Senior Vice President of Research and Development talked about the rapidly shifting way in which big pharma is working, and mentioned an unacceptable fact that should make us all reflect on how much the patent system is broken:
 Pfizer has 98,000 employees&amp;hellip; and 31,000 lawyers!
 The rest of the day I attended classes by Catherine Tucker, Brian Halligan, and a speech by Dean David Schmittlein.</description>

Snowing, cold, snow, cold&amp;hellip;
Day 2 of the MIT-EDP program has been crazy. Breakfast at 7:00am, classes from 9:00am until 7:00pm, with a lunch break that was actually a lecture too, and two 15 minute breaks in which we were suppose to sign up for company visits, pick up material, etc&amp;hellip;
But it was worth it: William Aulet, and Fiona Murray are excellent lecturers with obviously a lot of experience.</description>

I am here to take the MIT Sloan Executive EducationEDP (Entrepreneurship Development Program).
Getting up at 4 am and braving the fluoutbreakin Boston and the cold weather including a frozen Charles River (not like it is less cold in NY anyway), I arrived from NY this morning in an early flight, and after checking in at the Marriot, I went to a luncheon at the Towne Stove and Spiritsrestaurant sponsored by Ken Morse.</description>

      <description>The second week of January I flew to Lima (Peru) for an important business meeting. It was a hard trip: overnight flight from New York, straight to meeting, and overnight flight back. But there was no other way to fit the trip in my schedule.
A few days later I flew with my fiancée to Valencia both for business and for pleasure.It was a cloudy and &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; week (for Valencia anyway, because 58ºF could hardly count as &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo;, considering it is 11ºF now in New York).</description>

This year I spent Christmas at Niagara Falls.
While it is one of the natural wonders of the world, I had not thought about visiting it before because I did not expect it to be &amp;ldquo;worth it&amp;rdquo;. How wrong I was! Not only it is a lovely area (the Canadian side, at least), albeit certainly quite &amp;ldquo;touristic&amp;rdquo;, but the waterfalls indeed are amazing. You stand so close to the water, intense green, that you can feel it rush, precipitate, and crash.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday Stephanie [thank you!] invited me to see &amp;ldquo;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&amp;rdquo; at Richard Rodgers Theatre (Broadway, New York) with Scarlett Johansson.
Although I had seen the movie, perhaps because I was too young to understand, or perhaps because in the movie the plot is not as clear, the truth is that I enjoyed and understood Tennessee Williams play much better this time. And it has a much broader appeal than what I initially guessed (being a _Southern Gothic_ work).</description>

      <description>Red dyes sky and &amp;ldquo;sea&amp;rdquo;, as they call it, as the sun sets over the Rio de la Plata.
The promenade fills up with Montevideans with their mates. They smile, oblivious to, or despite of, life`s drama.
This intense red bursts, invades, dyes and covers like a curtain. I must share it with you.
It`s ephemeral, I know it will pass, but now it feels as if nothing can escape its spillover, which drags along my attention, my sensibility, my pain, my life.</description>

December 2nd I flew to Montevideo. I stayed at the Radisson Hotel, Plaza de la Independencia. Very conveniently located with some impressive views from the top floor. Good thing it had a pool, because it is not easy to keep my exercise regime when traveling so much.
Besides very productive meetings with IBM (very nice, professional, and friendly executives, by the way) and presentation to several hospital groups (one of the meetings at the Presidential Building, another one at the country`s largest hospital, and a presentation at the Solis Theater), I enjoyed the promenade by the river which seems like a sea, the old town, and a weird Ice Bar.</description>

I stayed at the very nice Public Hotel, attended the crazy big RSNA show, had dinner at Petterino‘s with Brazilian friends, and flew back to NY.</description>

      <description>The last week of my November trip to Spain, I went to Malaga for the MIT Technology Review Emtech Investors Forum event.
It was very sad and unfortunate that the mayor of Malaga did not listen to the organizers of the event, and stubbornly forced the event to be inaugurated November 22nd &amp;ldquo;becuase it was more convenient for him&amp;rdquo;. Since the main interest of the event were the US investors, they did not come because it was Thanksgiving.</description>

      <description>I have fallen very behind on my posts. I tweet and Google+ some tidbits here and there, but it has been forever since I posted. So, I`ll try to catch up.
In mid November, I was in Barcelona for the &amp;ldquo;Global Sales Strategy for Ambitious European Firms&amp;rdquo; Program (who chooses those names?). Classes, by Kenneth P. Morsetook part in ESADE Business School (Executive Education).
Two intense days of learning, thinking, debating, and networking.</description>

      <description>Astonished I witness the trees rise
tall from their base,
not even rooted.
Leafs leave,
group,
organize,
and shifting shapes,
take to the sky
only to dive down.
A red dragon,
a viking vessel,
coming straight at me.
The memory of holding your hand,
and blinking,
gets me through.
But how far could even a never fading memory take me?
I shall hold your hand again, or be taken by the leafs.</description>

      <description>Although it may not be too obvious, I have been going through a few very hard weeks for several reasons. So someone who knows me well told me I should not be stupid, and should have fun. Let`s be it, then!
As part of their James Bond 50 years celebration, MoMA has been showing some of 007 movies in their collection (the largest by any museum in the world). So yesterday I was invited, and I of course invited Stephanie to be my guest, to the screening of the latest James Bond movie: &amp;ldquo;007 Skyfall&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>From tilted posts to trees completely gone, after hurricane Sandy there were many signs of destruction around New York.
I had to stay at Stepahnie`s apartment (thank you again!) until Monday, because my building remained without power. And even after the power returned, the telephone and internet took two more days.
Some people were not so lucky, with all hotels fully booked, and had to stay at home for days without power or water.</description>

      <description>To go from Baltimore to NY has been a real nightmare. I had a return train ticket for the 29th at night, but that was obviously cancelled. Amtrak then rebooked me on the first train out of Baltimore (at 03:45am on November 1st), and since flights or buses were not operating, I took it.
The nice lady at the travel agency got me a reservation on a flight to La Guardia.</description>

      <description>I`m still stuck in Baltimore, but it seems I will be able to return to NY late tonight, arrivingtomorrow morningafternoon, the day after Halloween (which reaches amazing levels, like Barbie special edition dolls).
So, instead of going to the Village Halloween parade(which has been cancelled for the first time in 39 years), or anyof the Halloween parties I was invited to (the New Museum and Cara`s parties have also been cancelled), and wear the cool and simple MineCraft Creeper costume Cory Doctorow twitted(from Comic Con NY):</description>

Both Ben Shapiro and Gregory Crewdson(and his mother) were there introducing the film. But their shyness made them refuse a formal Q&amp;amp;A session, so to talk to them one had to go to the reception area after the film and mingle and chat.</description>

      <description>Note: Start video on 33:33 (absolutely nothing happening before that, but just people waiting for the panelist to go on stage).On Friday I was invited to attend Slavoj Žižeks lecture &amp;quot;Conditions of Possibility&amp;quot; with M. Hägglund &amp;amp; A. Johnston at City University of New Yorks Graduate Center.
Martin Hägglund (associate professor of comparative literature and humanities at Yale University) and Adrian Johnston (professor in the department of philosophy at the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque and a faculty member at the Emory Psychoanalytic Institute in Atlanta) both read legthy and endogamic discourses about Heidegger, classic philosophical concepts, and stubbornly narrow minded &amp;ldquo;canons&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>A big band of skaters (I only captured a few in my photograph becuase they were left behind in a stoplight, but there were many many more) rolling down south on Broadway. As they passed, people on the side walk greeted and cheered them. More play and less politics, or the return of the playful society, please. [Update.- there is a big story behind it: the Broadway Bomb] Beecher`s Handmade Cheese, where you can sample and purchase artisanal cheese, have some wine and small apetizers in the cellar downstairs, but even more fun to just sit and watch them make cheese live, through a big glass.</description>

      <description>Tuesday, October 2nd I was invited to the member`s viewing and reception of &amp;ldquo;Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu&amp;rdquo; exhibition at Japan Society. This exhibition is the first American retrospective of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828), a samurai aristocrat turned Buddhist monk who dedicated his life to art and poetry. On exhibit there were also a few works by his chief pupil Suzuki Kiitsu, although I must admit the difference between the two is quite notable.</description>

I also wanted to meet Cory Doctorow (although we actually ended up not meeting). It has been years since I last met him, and it was the perfect &amp;ldquo;excuse&amp;rdquo; to attend the conference.
When I arrived, I was really surprised to see the size of it.</description>

– United Airlines choice of dinner was &amp;quot;beef or chicken&amp;quot;. Whatever happened to the broadly accepted vegetarian-friendly classic pasta choice? Besides, the chicken was breaded, in a white bun, and the &amp;quot;beef&amp;quot;, lets just say it did not look too good.</description>

      <description>Autumn.
My skin falls and yours is not there.
I turn to the canvas, but its not color I want to smear your whiteness with. I face the white screen, but its not light that I seek.
I confront the blank page, but words will not bring solace.
Then my skin falls on the piano ivory.
Fingers sliding down each key.
Caresses that the air won`t keep.
The music was already playing in my head.</description>

      <description>The Norse vs Inuit approach
There are many seemingly &amp;ldquo;small events&amp;rdquo; in history to which we do not pay much attention, when actually they provide very important lessons. I always talk about historical examples of perfectly successful cooperatives and anarchist self government. But this time I want to comment on a very different historical event: the Norse attempt to colonize Greenland.
When the Norse tried to colonize Greenland, the Inuit already lived there.</description>

      <description>Afghanistan already is the longest (official) war in US history.
In order to begin to understand that mess, as usual in modern history, we may have to go back to the end of World War II, when Pakistan`s colonial nominees, the &amp;ldquo;Taliban&amp;rdquo;, were sent to take over Afghanistan to give them a strategic edge over India in the war over Kashmir.
Today the Taliban and Pakistans ISI (Directorate for Inter-Service Intelligence) alliance are at the heart of why the USA is stuck in an endless war: the USA aligns, or so it would seem, much more with India in terms of values, policy, economy, etc, than with Pakistan.</description>

September 5th I went to thisevent I already talked about.
September 7th I was invited to attend the premiere of a documentary about Gerhard Richter at the New Museum. It was very revealing and sad to see how Richters art critic/historian proposed an interpretation of one of his paintings that Richter did not seem to agree on, but after a few minutes of conversation, he &amp;quot;accepted&amp;quot;.</description>

Besides the panelist (Pattie Astor, Fab Five Freddy, Lady Pink, and Lee Quinones), there were many old glories and a couple of aspiring bomber kids in the audience that I am sure were tagging walls late that night.
What started as a celebration, a remembrance, and a comunion, as the liturgy advanced ended up becoming a hurtful vindication and even a flat out purist attack.</description>

October
 October
And the trees are stripped bare
Of all they wear
What do I care
October
And kingdoms rise
And kingdoms fall
But you go on&amp;hellip;and on&amp;hellip;
 So many literal meanings: the fear of wearing-out (The Edge was considering leaving the band like his brother did before they were even called U2), the false sense of security arising from self-defeat (&amp;ldquo;What do I care&amp;rdquo;), moving on after a loss (both Bono and Larry had just lost their mothers), the high hopes and expectations arising from new democracies in Eastern Europe only to become despair and dissapointment, and eventually resilience, surviving, going on&amp;hellip;</description>

 Two South Africans set out to discover what happened to their unlikely musical hero, the mysterious 1970s rock ‘n` roller, Rodriguez.
 While the movieis a very good one, and the story quite powerful (not only a human story about an incredible musiciancalled Rodriguez, better than Bob Dylan if you allow me the heresy), there are two aspects that go well beyond the typical in this kind of documentary:</description>

Moderated by Nan Aron (lecturer, author, and President of Alliance for Justice), the panel consisted of:
 Angelo Falcón: President and Founder of the National Institute for Latino Policy Keesha Gaskins: Senior Counsel in the Brennan Center`s Democracy Program Lawrence Lessig: Professor of Law at Harvard University (and much more) John Samples: Director of the Cato Institute Center for Representative Government  The discussion was quite interesting.</description>

      <description>I have been puzzled by an incompatibility between WP`s latest version and one of the plug-ins I have installed (the one that allows multiple languages).
As soon as I fix it, I will resume my postings.

      <title>The second half of August</title>

      <description>August is over. What did the second half bring?
August 17th, after a lovely walk on the HighLine, Lytroorganized a photowalk on the Lower East Side (LES).
August 18th I had a nice talk about Russian art with the former Artistic Director of the State Russian Theater of Estonia, who is now working at the Lincoln Centerin New York.
August 19th morning I had another very interesting conversation with an NYU Philosophy professor regarding learning, engagement&amp;hellip; and reality, while having a delicious coconut ice cream.</description>

      <description>One after another. Light, quick, nonchalant.
Poured, as a quick one-sided conversation, the messages kept coming in.
On the background, music by an unknown artist. Unknown even to himself. Adding a reggae-folk soundtrack that sounded unintendedly tragic. The guitar riffs camouflaging the &amp;ldquo;new-message&amp;rdquo; tones. But the desperation kept building up. With every superficial message, a poignant indication that the truth was, still, being concealed. Or worse: never revealed. Each new line, a ticker tape reminder of how little he matter, how opaque and transparent he had become at once.</description>

      <description>Before more days go by and I forget the things I have been doing, here is a quick run-down for the first half of August (the last day of July I went to a Sigur Rós concert in Prospect Park):
August 1st I went to the MoMA to watch Hitchcock`s &amp;ldquo;To catch a thief&amp;rdquo; and eat at the nearby Le Pain Quotidien.
August 2nd, instead of taking advantage of the invitation to the Park Avenue Armory for the opening night party for Janet Cardiff &amp;amp; George Bures Miller: &amp;ldquo;The Murder of Crows&amp;rdquo;, I went to AlphaOne Labs for a 3D printing session.</description>

      <description>The first one was the archiving and preservation of film. While an interesting debate by itself, it is not as important as it seemed to them, since, as I see it, technology will catch up and surpass the needs and expectations in a matter of very few years. Although a lot could be said about culture, preservation, archiving, formats, etc. Which leads us to&amp;hellip; The second one: it was a very brief moment, when upon the comment &amp;ldquo;somebody has to be the taste maker&amp;rdquo; by one of the producers being interviewed, Keanu, as interviewer said &amp;ldquo;wow&amp;rdquo;.</description>

When you make the tools available to the people, and allow them to create (in this case under the safe harbor of &amp;ldquo;parody&amp;rdquo;) wonderful things happen. Its NOT all about the money, profit, control... Its about imagination, art, creativity, culture. Thats how it happens: copying, re-using, mixing, adjusting, modifying... thats what creativity is really about (or did you think it was about &amp;ldquo;inventing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;making unheard of things out of thin air&amp;rdquo;?</description>

      <title>A multidimensional matrix of epistemology</title>

      <description>I have no clue about physics or philosophy. But just like, when thinking theoretical physics, I cant help but reach the conclusion that time is a form of energy, when I think of epistemology, I cant help but to think of it in a multidimensional matrix, of which we can usually only grasp part, because the interconnexions we trace are linear an unidirectional.
It`s a well known fact that our brain is not built to comprehend reality, but &amp;ldquo;to make sense&amp;rdquo; of it.</description>

Well, reality, resource constraints, day-to-day life&amp;hellip; are all excuses not to take ones passion and live it. So I am going to live it. How? I dont know. But the first step is to share, and to make accessible, my plans, ideas, and projects.

      <description>Five days ago, the New Museum invited me to the &amp;ldquo;All White Party&amp;rdquo;. It`s one of those events I would not normally go by myself, but Jane told me about the rooftop bar that only opens on weekends and during parties, so I decided to go and check it out. Plus, I was told it was the only chance I would have to see new yorkers dressed in white.
As it was to be expected, lot of people, quite a few &amp;ldquo;celebrities&amp;rdquo;, and 95% wearing white (with your typical &amp;ldquo;I am wearing black, to signal I am bad, or odd, or fun, or whatever&amp;rdquo;, two or three &amp;ldquo;ooops, I thought they were joking about the white – or I don`t have white clothes – and I am wearing my grey/orange shirt&amp;rdquo; and a petite blonde wearing black skirt and white top).</description>

      <description>Before I forget more (I am sure I am leaving out a lot), here is a little recap of things I`ve done, tried, or discovered in NY during July:
July 1st I went to Strand, my favorite bookstore, with its cool graffiti outside.
and then went to the &amp;ldquo;Exquisite Corpses: Drawing and Disfiguration&amp;rdquo; Party at the MoMA with Nebula.

It was a lot of fun, as usual. Besides the many and informative talks(we gave one on &amp;ldquo;Digital Security in Health Care Institutions&amp;rdquo;, the first day), there was music, booths (FSF, EFFwith a girl that wanted to come to Spain to help the #indignados, Free Manning, No Starch PressBooks and more), arduino and lock-picking classes, a pro-ponies and against-zombies USA Presidential Candidate wearing a boot on his head, MakerBot3D printers, the IMMI, Hackers For Charity, AlphaOneHackerSpace (will be visiting it next Thursday with Audrey), StartUpHire, SparkleLabs(awesome presents for kids and n00bies!</description>

The famous &amp;quot;Sunscreen&amp;rdquo; music video(the text comes from an essaywritten in 1997 by Mary Schmich, a columnist at the Chicago Tribune, as a graduation speech for the class of `97) which gives some amazing advice for life. There is even a StarWars Version.

      <description>After reading &amp;ldquo;Debunking Putin`s Newest Myth&amp;rdquo; by Alexander Yanov, PhD, and with all my respect and admiration for this very well known historian of Russian nationalisms:
Although quite brilliant and eloquent, I believe it is not incisive and daring enough in debunking Putin`s newest myth. It takes a very conservative approach, perhaps letting a Western traditional philosophy baggage and inclination take the part of pure reason and belief, which is usually needed, in equal parts, to fight a political/philosophical quarrel.</description>

  It is still for Mac OSX only. They NEED to come out with Open Source / Free Software (both their software AND platform support for GNU/Linux).
  Picture library size and location. BIG unresolved issue.

      <description> Accompanied by your absence
I hear your skin calling.
Silently, still, I answer.
In the solitude of your presence
I remember sliding down your gaze
fearlessly falling into your void,
your being`s foyer.
Next to you, finally, I rest
dreaming and longing,
with the peace and tranquility that comes from
knowing me you.  </description>

From Tokyo to San Francisco, Madrid to Seoul, the Spanish photographer Nebula has traveled to 10 cities in 4 countries in order to find inspiration and the right images (somethimes a fleeting reflexion of it) to bring to life what she feels about art, identity, apropriationism, feminism, and psychoanalysis.</description>

      <description>In a sort of &amp;ldquo;NY diary&amp;rdquo;, here is what the last two weeks of June had in store for me.
 June 17th:  I went to Cha`Anin the heart of the East Village, for a very delicious tea ceremony. And it was delicious not just because of the great matcha tea (usucha) and wagashi, but also because Noriko-san was such an excellent host, performing an excellent otemae. Being a public restaurant, and not a private house, not everything was &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo;, like in the tokonoma, where the scroll was obviously generic.</description>

 If my gate is C, why do I have to go to Terminal B? Go through security twice. #ThankYouIdiots
 So, once in Chicago, straight to my first meeting at IBM Innovation Center. Intense, interesting&amp;hellip; and off to my hotelfor a few hours of preparing for the next day (and BIG meeting). The next day, great presentations and meetings (including lunch with the big boss), and something very interesting: they had a Watson interactive kiosk with which anyone could try and compete at Jeopardy.</description>

      <description>Two places I tried June 10th in West Village:  Tea &amp;amp; Sympathy: UK charm (irony intended) and Tea+Scones, at high prices, minimum consumption ($11 per person!!), and they don`t even know how to serve tea (full pot, loose leaves&amp;hellip; no way to get them out to avoid over infusion of second cup). Avoid. Smörgås Chef: decent Scandinavian restaurant, with their own eco-farm.  </description>

 Dear New Yorker, Many thanks for your email expressing your support for our city`s libraries. [&amp;hellip;]
We cant do it alone, though, and I hope youll consider signing up for Council &amp;ldquo;enews&amp;rdquo;. These issue-based e-mail updates are a great way for us to stay connected and engaged with you and other New Yorkers about the budget, healthcare, and other important issues affecting our city.</description>

First, off to Brooklyn Flea Market(Fort Greene this time). Sure enough, the subway is a mess like any weekend, but one gets used to it. With a punishing sun, the first thing upon arrival is to hydrate (limenade, although I was tempted to try something they called &amp;ldquo;orchata&amp;rdquo; which was not, since it was made from coconut and rice), and eat something (palak dosa, and zucchini cheese pupusa&amp;hellip; I missed Mimi&amp;amp;CoCo‘s teriyaki balls or TheRegalVegantreats).</description>

      <description>As I head for the shower at the gym, wondering if I should stay longer on the bike, lift more weights, or try a new boxing class, I find the real meaning of strength lying right there in front of me.</description>

      <description>Some people enjoy shopping. Some enjoy the action, other the object, others the fantasy of being able to &amp;ldquo;acquire&amp;rdquo; that which they feel (or society made them feel) they &amp;ldquo;lack&amp;rdquo; (beauty, strength, appeal&amp;hellip; whatever).
Last week, while at the SoHo, I found myself enjoying window shopping. The design. Pure art. Beauty.</description>

      <description>Last Saturday I went to the MET for the symposium &amp;ldquo;Michelangelo and His World in the 1490s&amp;rdquo;. Presented by some of the most distinguished Michelangelo`s scholars, there was a lot of in-depth info on this very exceptional artist. Here are some of the most curious trivia I learned:
 He was an exceptional painter and art forger from a very early age (when he was 12 years old he forged and smoked to make it look old, church paintings) and that`s why his father enrolled in an art studio at 13, even though the minimum age was 14.</description>

But then, again, we end up with things like Ubuntu Satanic(and their Ubuntu SE 666.10 “Necrophiliac Neuromancer”), Hannah Montana Linux(how far would you go to attract kids to free software?), or Red Star OS(free software for North Korea and non-free browsing?

      <description>May 15th I went to the #15M demosntration in Malaga (Spain). As I was by myself, and to document and support &amp;ldquo;the cause&amp;rdquo;, I took my camerca and zig-zagged thourgh the crowd, in a kind of amateur sociological analysis of the most interesting social movement in these turbulent times. Here are some not-so-random thoughts:
 While no particular spacial organization can be detected in the demonstration, the group dynamics and power hierarchy (even if perceived representation power) applied their invisible forces once more to take the radicals (or most outspoken at least) to march in the front line, families in the middle, and party goers and curious at the back Most &amp;ldquo;organizers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;speakers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;banner-holders and support van drivers&amp;rdquo; were foreign (mainly Argentinians) Although supposedly devoid of political affiliation, the only ones showing political signs were those without direct political representation in the form of &amp;ldquo;their own party&amp;rdquo; (anarchist, republicans, etc) While there was no &amp;ldquo;organized plan of action&amp;rdquo; (I wonder if the &amp;ldquo;assemblies&amp;rdquo; could get to one without some sort of non-hierarchical order and/or structure), the #cazerolada and #lacaixaesmordor seem to channel the discontempt towards the direct real cause (superficial, first and most apparent, but not necessarily the most important) of the dire social tensions of today: banks and the financial system&amp;hellip; although how about the political system that allowed that to happen (from corruption to &amp;ldquo;democratic&amp;rdquo; representation)?</description>

      <description>On Tuesday I went to the studio of jewelry designer Monique Péan, with Margot Norton (curatorial associate, New Museum, New York).
While it was interesting (in a &amp;ldquo;makes me sick but I need to learn this even if it seems impossible to achieve without the right connexions&amp;rdquo; forensics approach) to hear her perfectly polished &amp;ldquo;politically correct and marketing saavy&amp;rdquo; bio and artist statement, what really interested me was the striking beauty of fossilized ivory and minerals from the Artic.</description>

      <description>Wednesday May 2nd, I had the pleasure to meet Fernando Sabaterat Instituto Cervantes, NY.
The conversation was lighthearted and included many anecdotes and trvia, but also a good dose of Philosophy and Psychology wisdom and aphorisms (like those by Andrés Newman). Here are some delicious quotes by him:
  Dont attack, dont comply Childhood is always bad: wether because it was bad and left you a trauma, or because it was good and it frustrates you to leave it behind Happyness is also hard to bear Skepticism grows, and thats why when I am about to make a statement (particularly if it is a grand one) I end up laughing.</description>

      <title>Japanese dance at Japan Society and dinner at Sakagura</title>

      <description>Yesterday I went to Japan Society for the Kota Yamazaki/Fluid hug-hug (glowing)dance.
I must admit, regardless of having read the description and program, that I did not understand anything at all. Not even after hearing Kota Yamazaki explain his work after the show. So, I did the only thing a reasonable person can do when approaching art and not understanding: feel.
While the apparent lack of linear narrative or character identification makes it hard to approach, the dancers movements (rather than the much touted but ineffective light design), unobtrusive (and minimal) sound landscape by Kohji Setoh, and the elegant twist with the hanging wooden props becoming physical space at the end, played together surprisingly well.</description>

      <description>On Friday, at lunch time, I went to the Guggenheim to meet Susan Thompson, Curatorial Assistant, for a tour of Francesca Woodman exhibition.
Although Francesca Woodman`s photographs are undeniably subtle and portray the mind of a troubled young woman (body, space, self, disgust, identity, etc), it is a pity she took her life so early, leaving us with what is obviously a truncated body of work, one that begins, explores, promises&amp;hellip; but never concludes because death found her first.</description>

Besides the very interesting bio/background overview of them that the interviewer did, here are some quotes that caught my attention.
Walt Mossberg:

      <description>Last Saturday, given that the Anarchist Art Festival seemed a little weak, I decided to spend the day at the MoMA (Museum of Modern Art, New York).
First, a nice tour of &amp;ldquo;The Shaping of New Visions: Photography, Film, Photobook&amp;rdquo; exhibition (Edward Steichen Photography Galleries, third floor) by Dr. Elizabeth Cronin, assistant curator of photography at MoMA and NYPL. This exhibition, covering the period from 1910 to today, offers a critical reassessment of photographys role in the avant-garde and neo-avant-garde movements—with a special emphasis on the mediums relation to Dada, Bauhaus, Surrealism, Constructivism, New Objectivity, Conceptual, and Post-Conceptual art—and in the development of contemporary artistic practices.</description>

In my high-tech gym, you have the option to have a lot of data collected, for your own, private and personal use. It seems like a great idea at first.</description>

I have these 4 criminals` magnetic puppets on my fridge. 2 were outlawed (and had to flee) by German Nazis. 1 had to flee Spanish dictatorship because he was a Communist. And the other one was thrown in jail by British occupation forces for &amp;ldquo;passive resistance&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Yesterday, since I had to go to the Japan Society to take care of some business, I took the opportunity to visit the Deco Japan: Shaping Art and Culture, 1920–1945 exhibition (I was invited to the opening, but I could not make it that day).
[mudslide:picasa,0,111219615350942087056,5730180317126910177]
 Curated by Dr. Kendall Brown, Deco Japan: Shaping Art and Culture, 1920–1945 subtly conveys the complex social and cultural tensions in Japan during the Taisho and early Showa periods through dramatically designed examples of metalwork, ceramics, lacquer, glass, furniture, jewelry, sculpture and evocative ephemera such as sheet music, posters, postcards, prints and photography.</description>

      <description>On September 28, 2011, Hou Hanru, Director of Exhibitions and Public Programs at the San Francisco Art Institute said on a lecture (Curator`s Perspective) in New York:
 I think the worst exhibition in the world is the exhibition that is organized like a book. We see this a lot, an exhibition that takes the artwork as an illustration of a concept. I think an exhibition is not necessary for this: frankly, it`s too expensive.</description>

      <description>Tonight I went and see Tatsumiat the MoMA Film (Theater 2), a 2011 animation film from Singapore, directed by Eric Khoo, with the voice of Yoshihiro Tatsumi (who brought innovation to Japanese comics through works of social commentary aimed at an adult audience in postwar Japan in the late 1950s). A Drifting Life, Tatsumi’s epic graphic novel memoir, forms the foundation for the film.
Interesting the unavoidable paralel one can draw between Italys neorealism postwar cinema and Tatsumis works.</description>

      <description>This morning I have been at the MET. First I took advantage of the invitation to preview the Dawn of Egyptian Artexhibition which will be on display April 10–August 5, 2012.
While there were many remarkable pieces (for several reasons) in the exhibition, this coyote figure completely captivated me. The legs position denote movement, which is uncommon in animal depictions of the later eras. The reason being that as art evolved, and became &amp;quot;institutionalized&amp;quot; in Ancient Egypt, it adhered more closely to standards and canons, loosing some if the earlier works creativity and freedom, such as this one.</description>

      <description>There is a lot of debate and analysis on why is the US healthcare system so freakingly expensive (basic answer: greedy inhuman and short sighted powerful economic interest added to puppet politicians and sheepish voters). Here is one real life example: a friend in Atlanta told me that he went to the hospital ER after feeling intense chest pain. He knew it was most likely a strong episode of acid reflux (he had been suffering from that for some time), but it was so severe, he got scared and wanted to check.</description>

      <description>Today I went to one of MoMA`s members-only gallery talks. This one was about their currentCindy Shermanexhibition(great website, by the way).
Rather than rambling on about Cindy Sherman`s interesting work (an obvious reference to identity, stereotypes, social criticism, art depiction, etc, with her easily recognizable periods and themes), on which there are many articlesthese days, here are some anecdotes:
 Photography is not allowed (I really hate it when museums do not allow photography), so why do they place QRs (particularly when the phone coverage is quite bad)?</description>

      <description>Atlanta`s Hartsfield airport has been having one of those uselessscanners that show passengers naked for a while now. But the last time I was there, they were being tested, and most passengers did not go through them. Today, though, as I approached the security line, I saw that next to every metal detector, there was one of those scanners. &amp;ldquo;Wow, this is getting worse&amp;rdquo;, I thought, while seeing how almost everybody was going through the scanners.</description>

I purchased the Art Spaces Directory last week, and I believe it is an excellent work, useful informative, needed. But the symposium was&amp;hellip; sad, to say the least: a bunch of gallery (art-spaces) curators, unable to play a PowerPoint (sic&amp;hellip; makes me sick), and regurgitating exhibit picture after exhibit picture while vomiting names after names of artists, collectives and the like.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday I visited the studio of Madeline Weinribon 5th Ave., New York.
Located on an impressive loft, her new studio (it used to be located at her apartment above a small museum in SoHo) is, as one would have imagined, full of decorative and inspirational elements, plus lots and lots of fabric samples, books and pictures.
In an informal conversation, Madeline explained her move from painter to fabric designer in 1997 (although she &amp;ldquo;forgot&amp;rdquo; to mention the connexion to her great-grandfather`s company), her world-wide network of artisans and suppliers, and her obvious historical design pattern &amp;ldquo;inspirations&amp;rdquo; (curious how she considers large manufacturers are &amp;ldquo;ripping her off&amp;rdquo; by copying &amp;ldquo;her patterns&amp;rdquo;, when her work is such an obvious &amp;ldquo;appropriation&amp;rdquo; from well known historical-cultural patterns such as the zig-zag or the muslim interlocks, as she describes it in this interview).</description>

      <description>The Japan Society invited me to L`Arc~en~Cielconcert at the Madison Square Gardenlast night, so there I went.
L`Arc~en~Cielis a Japanese rock band formed in 1991 in Osaka. The group has sold over 13 million albums, and 16 million singles. Currently on a world tour (obviously last night in NY), their upcoming London and Jakarta concerts are already sold out, and their NY concert was bigger than expected.
Given their JPop-rock sound, no wonder the Madison Square Garden was almost fully packed with Japanese, although there were more than teenagers, like the &amp;ldquo;respectable moms&amp;rdquo; in their 50s, 3 rows ahead of me, who could not stop swinging and laughing and singing, or the guy next to me, there with his wife, who waited patiently for the concert to start while reading manga in his iPad.</description>

The &amp;ldquo;party&amp;rdquo; was, as most &amp;ldquo;parties&amp;rdquo; in the USA: drinks, and people. Thats basically it. The music was soft enough that it was barely perceivable (unlike the New Museums party, where DJs try to make it impossible to talk to the person next to you).
So, why all the fuss? Why go to a &amp;ldquo;party&amp;rdquo; that has basically nothing to offer in terms of &amp;ldquo;fun&amp;rdquo;?</description>

While not huge in size, and populated with many dealers selling mostly Chinese and Indian antiques (but also contemporary and from many other Asian countries, from Japanese to Vietnamese), there were some extremely interesting pieces that caught my eye, such as the Joseph G. Gerena collection of Ainu Art Special Exhibit (with particular emphasis on IkupausyIkupasuy prayer sticks), the paintings of Hong Viet Dung carried by Judith Day, the marvelous washi sheets in display by Hiro Odaira(Precious Pieces), the small bags of Mark Walberg Fine Art and Antiques, and above all, a pice of the wonderful yugenart that Shari Cavin from Cavin-Morris Gallerycarefully explained to me: a Japanese ceramics professor puts discarded (outdated) physics university books in his kiln, at the right temperature, where the ink disappears, the pages curl, and the silices in the book cristalize, leaving a beautiful new object.</description>

How wrong I was. Let`s just say it was sooooo disappointing(at least for someone, like me, who knows almost nothing about art), that I was left with a feeling of wonder. Not about the works, but how, who, and why, did they decide to include it in the exhibition.</description>

Dr. Branfoot is, I am sure, a world renowned expert, and the MET has some wonderful education programs. And this one in particular was filled to capacity, such that I had to watch it from an adjacent &amp;ldquo;study room&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>So, Sunday came and my feet were already trembling scared in anticipation of another art overdose. Let`s go!
I spent the morning walking around some of Manhattans Lower East Side (LES) galleries with artist &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;httpss://leewells.org/home/&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;httpss://leewells.org/home/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Lee Wells&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.

      <description>On Saturday I went to The Armory Show 2012. So many galleries, so little time. While everybody was talking about Marina Abramovic’s _Bed for Human Use _performance, Theaster Gates commissioned Pier 94 café piece, or Michael Riedel’s installation at New York’s David Zwirner’s booth (forget about the Nordic spaces)... I found other works much much more interesting. But thats what makes art`s subjectivity (apparently not so subjective) so appealing.
Although, for the first time I found myself (and was ment to be that way) inside a piece of exhibited art by Michelangelo Pistolettoat Galleria Continua‘s booth (I am not showing it here because it will soon be published in a book).</description>

Given, the station was not the coolest in NY, but what shocked me was that at the other end of the platform, there was a man on the floor, and people just passed by as if nobody was there.
So I crossed to the other side, and asked him if he needed help.</description>

      <description>On Thursday I went to the New York Museum of Arts and Design (MAD). Honestly, I wasn`t expecting much, but&amp;hellip; on the contrary, what a nice surprise!
[mudslide:picasa,0,111219615350942087056,5718498290671972801]
From Japanese exquisite design and art (subtle, delicate, and sensitive beauty that never ceases to soothe your soul) in &amp;ldquo;Beauty in all things&amp;rdquo;, to the awesomely curated &amp;ldquo;Swept Away: Dust, Ashes, and Dirt in Contemporary Art and Design&amp;rdquo;, to the amazing &amp;ldquo;Glasstress New York&amp;rdquo;, the whole museum was a joy to visit.</description>

      <description>After wasting hours trying to double space or insert extra line breaks when writing a new post or page in WordPress only to see that WordPress automatically filters the content to remove those extra spaces once you click the “Publish” button, I have found the solution (not as obvious and not readily available in support forums) by using the TinyMCE Advanced plugin, which adds additional functionality to the default WordPress editor, including the ability to stop WordPress from automatically stripping out “p” (paragraph) and “br” (line break) tags.</description>

Definitely a pleasure, an exhibition not to be missed, and true to Sarah`s aim: works that a photograph can not capture (not that the copyright zealots of the Asia Society would let you take pictures anyway).</description>

The text under this piece says:
 During the period of dictatorship in Argentina in the 1970s, gatherings of citizens were closely monitored as they were considered a threat to the government. At the same time group theory and venn diagrams were banned from primary school programs as they could provide a model for subversive thought.</description>

After a long line on the street, under the rain and cold wind (no wonder I have a cold now), the party started at 7:30pm in the main lobby: DJ, cocktails, and fluorescent rubber bands for a crowd eager to see and be seen.
Not one to particularly enjoy mingling and parties, I went upstairs to see the exhibition.</description>

There were many works on display, too many (and too complex or infuriatingly simple) to comment here. What was definitely not worth mentioning, from my ignorant point of view, was the Alterazioni Video &amp;ldquo;The New Cinema Event&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>This is the story of an L1 Visa. I will try to make it short, although some details have to be explained to be believed&amp;hellip;
In August of 2011 I thought of starting a US subsidiary of my software company in the USA, so I decided to move to New York to start it up and manage it. Since I needed a visa (form I-129) to live and work in the USA, I contacted an immigration lawyer (form G-28 and thousands of dollars) through a friend, and we started the whole process.</description>

      <description>Some hypocritical and absurd questions found in the DS-160 form, needed to get a US Visa:
 Do you have a mental or physical disorder that poses or is likely to pose a threat to the safety or welfare of yourself or others? Are you or have you ever been a drug abuser or addict? Have you ever violated, or engaged in a conspiracy to violate, any law relating to controlled substances?</description>

      <description>Due to my US Visa process (which was soooo long and curious that it requires a separate post), I have been &amp;ldquo;stuck&amp;rdquo; in Ottawa (Canada) for a week.
Sure, Canada would not be one of my priority travel destinations in the winter, particularly if (like me) you cant ski or ice skate. But since I am here, lets make the best of it: The National Gallery, Museum of Civilizations, Museum of War, Winterlude, and a few lovely food places (such as The Tea Store, Memories, or Oh So Good) and a bunch of mediocre ones, while staying in a very nice hotel/castle(with heated indoors pool and gym), will do the trick 😉</description>

His office was surprisingly small and functional compared to European &amp;ldquo;big government&amp;rdquo; offices. A nice reminder of how European bureaucracy and public sector spending in administration itself is burying us. But what caught my attention the most was the largest picture in the office: it was not Obama`s, a diploma, a family picture, a flag&amp;hellip; it was this:</description>

      <description>Yesterday I went to the New York Public Library to see Pedro Almodovars &amp;quot;Talk to her&amp;quot;, as part of a &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;httpss://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/12/06/films-pedro-almodovar&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;httpss://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/12/06/films-pedro-almodovar&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;series&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; of Almodovars films screenings in the NYPL. But, to my surprise, the screening (and remainder ones) had been cancelled.
I talked to the person in the information desk, and she told me that the collecting society (that would be the despicable SGAE, which does not even deserve a link in my blog) and Almodovar`s Production company (El Deseo Producciones) had raised what they had previously been asking for as royalties or compensation for the (free) screening of the (not in movie theater) films, and the amount they were now asking was so high, the NYPL could not afford it, so they had to cancel the screenings.</description>

      <description>Last Saturday I went to the ArtHack Exhibitclosing party at 319 ScholesSt, Brooklyn (New York).
Located in an industrial complex in Brooklyn, at night, loooong two blocks from the subway, graffiti all over, small door&amp;hellip; that gave way to heaven: young (I was the oldest hacker in that space, but I did not feel that way) energetic happy people tinkering with technology and proudly showing their &amp;ldquo;toys&amp;rdquo; (hacks, mashups, creations, or whatever).</description>

      <description>Antony and the Johnsonsperformed last Thursday 26th, at the Radio City Music HallSWANLIGHTS, a one-night-only performance commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), NY, the most amazing concert I have ever been to.
One would think that the fact that the performance took place in the world`s largest (and one of the most reputed) theater/music venue, or that the place was chock-full of celebrities (I had Björk right next to me in the line to pick up the reserved tickets), would add to the glamour and grandiose of the event.</description>

      <description>The net was all up in arms this week. After the marvelous uprising against SOPA and PIPA, the new battle ground was Twitter`s announcement of country specific censorship. Never mind that they are open about it (unlike Facebook), never mind that they are talking about their offices and employees in those countries where censorship is the law&amp;hellip; if you hear &amp;ldquo;censorship&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;net&amp;rdquo; get up and scream!

      <description>Last week I went to 3 exhibitions/events that have allowed me to see the importance of context in the interpretation (and enjoyment) of a work of art. Note that I differentiate &amp;ldquo;interpretation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;enjoyment&amp;rdquo;, although for many of us, those two concepts go hand in hand. But this is just a short post, so the Phenomenological Aesthetics will have to wait (you can read Dewey, Hartmann, Adorno, Ortega y Gasset, Sartre, etc, etc in the meantime 😉 )</description>

      <description>My shoulders and back still hurt, but it was previsible: one hour of Kendo with Ilaria Montagnani (Nike endorsed athlete, and one of the top trainers in NY according to the Wall Street Journal or New York Magazine), and you will not ever wonder how she got all those muscles in her body.
For some odd reason, Kendo feels natural to me. And I say odd, because I am usually lacking the required coordination and flexibility for almost any sport.</description>

      <title>Culture in today`s world in a state of polarized anomie</title>

      <description>When Émile Durkheim wrote on the concept of anomie (expanding on Jean-Marie Guyau`s work) in his 1897 book Suicide, he spoke of one end of anomie: a society with too much rigidity and little individual discretion causing a destructive mismatch (moral deregulation and an absence of legitimate aspirations).
This is happening in the XXI century world, in many countries: those totalitarian (military or religious) societies where the social rule, expectations, and repression conform a cage around individuals, deposessing them of their individuality, their aspirations, subtly (or otherwise) imposing a social corset where the individual can not be itself, concentrating only on breathing, surviving.</description>

      <description>As I walk towards my office, I see an ad that makes me sick (as a matter of fact, I see many, but this one points to something other that the consumerism-sexism-excess that we are so dangerously getting used to).
The ad says &amp;ldquo;Turn now into memories&amp;rdquo;. How wrong is that?!!
Now is now. Now has to be now. Now should be now. Now has to remain now.
When you strive to &amp;ldquo;turn now into memories&amp;rdquo;, you are missing out on the real now.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Sara, there is a very easy way to add code to your site to protest against SOPA:
Drop the following code in between your two tags on your site, your users will be redirected to the blackout page that describes what you are doing and why.
`Then, when the protest is over, simply remove the added code. The protest is starting at 12am on 1/18, and lasts 24 hours.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, along a MeetUp group, we visited several art galleries in Chelsea (NY): Mike Weiss Gallery, Gladstone Gallery, Luhring Augustine Gallery, Metro Pictures Gallery, The Pace Gallery, and Mary Boone Gallery.
Leaving my personal comments on the displayed works aside (as usual, the pleasure of this kind of pilgrimage is to leave your mind and senses open, and let the works and stimuli slowly sink in), one thing surprised me quite a lot: Ai Wei Wei‘s work Sunflower Seeds was supposed to be walked on (at least it did at the Tate Modern in London, for the first 10 days of the exhibit), but at Mary Boone Gallerythere is a security guard that prevents visitors from doing exactly what the artist intended.</description>

      <description>AccuWeatherhas an interesting system called RealFeel. For example, today is 22ºF, but when you step outside, you cant help scream &amp;quot;Shit, its cold!&amp;rdquo;. Accourding to the AccuWeathers RealFeel system (which I assume &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;httpss://www.experts123.com/q/how-does-the-patented-accuweather-realfeel-temperature-work.html&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;httpss://www.experts123.com/q/how-does-the-patented-accuweather-realfeel-temperature-work.html&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;takes into account more than just humidity&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, like wind), it feels like 10ºF.

      <description>My friend Victoria Contreras is a real Renaissance artist, what we would call today a hacker artist: one that explores different media, different methods, different interest, in a bold, almost childishly uninhibited playful way. While the influences are obvious, and not everything is on the same level (as is always the case in those who try it all), this is what I would call &amp;ldquo;a case of interesting people&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Today, at the gym`s lobby/reception area, a man was sitting waiting for his wife to come out of yoga class. When she does, he gets up to greet her, feels dizzy, and passes out, falling to the ground, and hitting his face on the floor.
Two men who were on their way out, walk over this man. They do not bother-care-ask what`s wrong. They do not offer assistance.
Finally, his wife (who witnessed the whole episode, paralyzed in fear) reacts, wakes him up, and makes sure his eye socket bleeding is not too profuse.</description>

A &amp;ldquo;horsehead&amp;rdquo; in the NY subway. What I love (and sometimes hate) about NY: nobody turned, laughed, commented, got scared, pointed a finger&amp;hellip; this is life as usual here.
&amp;ldquo;The Crazy Piano Guy&amp;rdquo; is Colin Huggins, a piano player that takes his piano to Madison Square Park and performs in public for free. Awesome.
Not only the latest Ferrari, Maserati&amp;hellip; once in a while you get to see cool vehicles as well 😉</description>

      <description>The USA has become the largest exporter of censorship.
Based on wrong beliefs, manipulated data, and self-declared ignorant politicians, their legislative body cooks up a law designed to restrict competition, serving the interests (apparently, although as any freshman Economics student will tell you, that is not really the case) of an oligopoly of media-(sic)culture megacorporations that would not recognized the present (not to say &amp;ldquo;future&amp;rdquo;) if it hit them in the face, represented by multi-million dollar copyright infringers, while stomping on basic citizens` rights (not that they seem to care anyway, since they allow such basic rights violations as warrantless GPS monitoring, or unlimited incarceration without trial).</description>

      <guid>https://blog.cortell.net/2012/01/color-associations-red-and-yellow/</guid>
      <description>Seeing certain color combinations, associations are sure to fly into anybody`s minds.
Usually, red and yellow will bring to mind things like flags (of Spain, Catalonia-Valencia, R, Security, and adding some shapes you could even think of Macedonia or China).
Beyond flags, Axomil, sunset, fire, peppers,tullips, ballons, ketchup and mustard, Flash, soccer referee cards, Superman&amp;hellip; there are SO many options.
But when you consider the hue, tone, context, memory, and further additional information, then those options start to get reduced.</description>

      <description>Although I like more &amp;ldquo;spiritual&amp;rdquo; martial arts, I had always wanted to try boxing (one of the few martial arts I had not tried yet). So today I had my first boxing session with Curtis Summit. Who is Curtis? This is his official short bio:
 Former professional boxer with 20 years of boxing experience who turned Pro in 1983 after advancing to the 1984 Olympics box off. With 26-9-2 pro records, 14TKOs on the national and international level, ranked No 2 in the world by the World Boxing Council, the World Boxing Association and the International Boxing Federation.</description>

      <description>See in Scientific American:
 &amp;ldquo;I could not survive without a ballpoint pen in my back pocket. It`s invaluable for scribbling notes on the front of my hand (my version of the PalmPilot&amp;hellip;) to remind me to do things I used to be able to remember unaided before my age converged with my IQ while traveling in opposite directions.&amp;rdquo;

      <description>In Dean &amp;amp; Delucayou can find the most exquisite culinary treats (most from Europe, of course). And while there are so many to choose from a foodie like me could not make his mind up in a hundred years, I must admit the cuteness of this snowman-cake won me over:
On the other hand, even when one sticks to very healthy vegetarian (mostly vegan, sometimes macrobiotic, but always with the exception of sushi) diet, it seems impossible to scape the &amp;ldquo;over-spiced&amp;rdquo; cooking in the US.</description>

      <description>The world around us is full of signs. I wont go on dabble about _signifiers_, _meanings_, and the psychoanalitycal importance of the _word_. But sometimes I just cant help myself, when I see a sign begging for a creative interpretation:
Cmon, dont tell me you don`t see something like:
 If you press this button, your mouth will become a hotspot
 or
 A giant asteroid is heading towards your SpaceInvaders spacecraft, push the button to destroy the asteroid with a Dune-sque voice-blast</description>

      <description>Of course, the first year living in NY, new year`s eve party HAD to include a peregrination to Times Square. And since we had tickets to the Iridium concert(the Mike Stern Band featuring Randy Brecker, John Patitucci &amp;amp; Dave Weckl), we figured we would get a taste of it taking the subway to 42nd/Times Square (since police closed the nearer 50th st station)&amp;hellip; and did we indeed!!
The Broadway/42nd intersection was incredibly packed.</description>

      <description>According to Wikipedia:
 The uncanny valley is a hypothesis in the field of robotics and 3D computer animation, which holds that when human replicas look and act almost, but not perfectly, like actual human beings, it causes a response of revulsion among human observers. The &amp;ldquo;valley&amp;rdquo; in question is a dip in a proposed graph of the positivity of human reaction as a function of a robot`s human likeness.</description>

      <description>To go to my officein Times Square by subway is an adventure in itself, not due to the intense exercise of avoiding waves of pedestrians, but from the very fascinating tunnels (there is a world down there of abandoned stations, marginal dwellers, and those things nobody talks about)
to what one can find in the stations themselves: music(from the saw lady, to YouBredRaptors), promotions (from an armored vehicle at the Army recruiting station at 42nd, to the Sesame Street characters wishing you happy holidays)&amp;hellip;anything.</description>

      <description>Tonight we went to the MaysonGallery inaugural inauguration &amp;ldquo;Launch&amp;rdquo; featuring works by Doug Henders, Scott Hewett, Michael Oatman, Jeff Quinn, Bastienne Schmidt, and Rodger Stevens. It was way too crowded to see the works, but it was fun. Particularly because we enjoyed dinner at almost next door JinJapanese restaurant.
But we wish we were at another art inauguration: IVAM`s Claudio Zirotti.
My dear friend and mentor presents &amp;ldquo;Without Time&amp;rdquo; (PDF), an excellent exhibit of his wonderful art at Valencia`s IVAM Modern Art Institute, until February 19th 2012.</description>

      <description>I used to think that a travel would much more interesting the more anecdotes and curious things happened on it. But as years go by, one learns the pleasure of a relaxed journey, of a memorable trip for the sake of it. This quick business trip to Salvador do Bahia (Brazil) has been one of those… almost.
I stayed at one &amp;ldquo;has-been&amp;rdquo; old-glory hotel (formerly belonging to Le Meridien), with a movie-set location: at the very tip of the peninsula, sea on both sides, and an absolutely stunning view from my 22nd floor room.</description>

PS: This morning I missed Macy`s Thanksgiving Paradebecause I miscalculated the angle. From my living room, the Empire State Building blocks the view, and from the sun deck (50th floor), being 2 streets to the East and 5 to the South made the viewing impossible. Next year, better to go to Central Park in the morning.</description>

In NY kids do not need to be told to avoid puddles: from a very early age, they learn when puddles are frozen in the winter, they are a deadly slippery trap. Freezing time approaching. Welcome to NY.</description>

      <description>In Spain we have a legal right called &amp;ldquo;private copy&amp;rdquo; by which anyone can make a copy (for non-commercial use) of their copyrighted content (movies, music, books, etc). To offset the supposed loss (many studies prove this &amp;ldquo;loss&amp;rdquo; to be a fallacy) we Spaniards pay the so-called &amp;ldquo;Digital canon&amp;rdquo;, a tax levied on blank media (CDs, HardDisks, printers, photocopiers, etc, etc) and managed by private monopolistic institutions called &amp;ldquo;collecting societies&amp;rdquo;, some run by supposed alcohol-consuming, whore-user, money-embezzler, tax-evading criminals (or so goes the accusations brought to a number of them by the Attorney General).</description>

      <description>When a M. Phil. from Cambridge, A.B. from Harvard, and M.D. from UCal writes an articleinsisting on a probabilistic fallacy, a trap where, in one way or another, many have fallen (from Eccles to Nagel), and this article is echoed in many sites (such as BoingBoing) and an infographicis made and becomes staff pick at visual.ly&amp;hellip; then you know ignorance is everywhere and very dangerous.
Read the article, then read Roy Weatherford`s &amp;ldquo;Philosophical foundations of probability theory&amp;rdquo; (or maybe something simpler), and once you grasp the concept of &amp;ldquo;a priori theories of probability&amp;rdquo;, laugh at those who think each one of us is a miracle&amp;hellip; we all are, but not because the probability of us being born is extremely small.</description>

      <description>Curious coincidence (or maybe not), two days after realising &amp;ldquo;something&amp;rdquo; was missing in one of my frequent logic diagrams, I saw an episodeof The Big Bang Theory in which Wollowitz discovers a flaw in Sheldon`s friendship algorithm.
Dr. Sheldon Cooper`s lack of a cycle counter in his friendship algorithmis not a trivial issue. The cycle counter is the &amp;ldquo;real life&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;context&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;awareness&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;empathy&amp;rdquo;, aspect of a logic interpretation of a social engagement.</description>

      <description>Perhaps all those people telling me &amp;ldquo;you`re trying to do too much at the same time&amp;rdquo; (thanks Ana, Remei, Juan&amp;hellip;) were right. Perhaps moving to NY and trying to make my company grow, not to mention &amp;ldquo;personal life&amp;rdquo;, is already time-consuming enough. Or perhaps there are other reasons&amp;hellip; but the truth is, I am dropping out of the fun and interesting AI course at Stanford University.</description>

      <title>OCW: Art in Spanish</title>

      <description>I have been interested in OCW (Open CourseWare) since the year 2000, when I tried to convince Polytechnic University of Valencia to upload all materials and lectures from the Master`s Degree (where I was lecturing) to the web for anyone to access.
Although quite slowly, OCW has come a long way. Years ago MIT and some others made a strong commitment for the OCW. But it has taken Spanish universities years to wake up and start to follow that lead.</description>

      <description>On Sunday October 9th we went to NY. Travel went smoothly and without anecdotes. We arrived, left things in the hotel(with its spectacular penthouse lounge that we had no time to visit) and we went for dinner (all the restaurants visited, here). Without exaggeration, from Monday 10 to Tuesday 18, virtually the entire time we were looking for apartments, visiting flats with and without agent, meeting with real estate agents, collecting information for signing the lease &amp;hellip; and the first thing we noticed is that without a local phone, it was all much more difficult.</description>

      <description>We all know TED. But there is a lot of information and academic material freely available online. Luckily that material is growing (education and science have always been areas which, unlike what copyrights zealots might want you to think, have grown thanks to sharing knowledge).
Some examples that I have found amazing:
– Integrative Biology, UCBerkley (English)
– Videosfrom Nobel lectures at Gustavus Adolphus College (English)
– Lectureson current neuroscience issues by Professor Francisco Rubia (Spanish)</description>

      <description>Everyday 156,000 people die in the world. Yesterday a Mexican flower seller died from shot wounds, a Chinese mother died giving birth, a Turkish photographer died, a kid soldier was killed in Uganda, a Japanese widower died in love, and an American computer entrepreneur died, amongst others.

      <description>According to this articlethe food people usually eat (thanks to my wife and my conscience, I have slightly healthier eating habits than most people) is pure shit: wood celulose in many foods, fruit juices over a year old, ammonia in meat, artificial blueberries, &amp;ldquo;free-range chicken&amp;rdquo; that is not free at all, and other lies.</description>

      <description>Since I will be moving to New York in a month, I have decided to make this blog bilingual. In doing so, I have wanted to mark all untraslated entries (almost 2000 of them) just in case some day I might think about translating them. That`s why the pesky (English) next to the title of previous entries shows when the blog is shown in Spanish.</description>
