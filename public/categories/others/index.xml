      <description>Thursday, September 15 I had several meetings in Silicon Valley.
The first one was with the Director of Strategic Investments at the Microsoft Technology Center in Mountain View. Since it is business related, I won`t comment anything about that very interesting meeting.
The second one was with a Partner at Google Ventures. The discussion was to the point and provocative. It is interesting to note that Google and Google Ventures are NOT the same company.</description>

      <description>My wife and I were invited to the inaugural cruise for the Norwegian Getaway. A &amp;ldquo;sister ship&amp;rdquo; to the Norwegian Breakaway, in which inaugural we cruised last year, this ship is almost exactly identical. We enjoyed fine dining at Le Bistro, Taste, and The Tropicana, cocktails and music at Bliss, and particularly entertainment:
 Comedian Ralph Harrisat the Headliners Comedy Club  Burn the Floorthe musical Illusionarium, a pretty good steam-punk themed magic show with dinner Buddy Valastro (Cake Boss) live cake decorating session  The return to port and docking gave us a nice view of Manhattan`s skyline, along with the scary view of the Hudson river with big chunks of ice (locals say that was unseen since 1977).</description>

      <description>After a very nice Thanksgiving with my wife`s family in Western New York, I flew directly to Chicago to spend the first week of December exhibiting alongside IBM and Avnet at a trade show called RSNA (Radiological Society of North America) with my friend and coworker Juan. Not only it was great for business, but we also saw some awesome technology (like 3D printing of organs), made friends, and had fun attending a couple parties.</description>

From the 6th to the 8th I was back in Montevideo(Uruguay) for business. Taking an all-night flight there (via Miami) to minimize time away, my time there was very productive, packed with interesting business meetings and presentations. It was worth the 5,339 miles.
I was lucky to meet with some very interesting doctors and executives, and to try some good restaurants (like Dueto and La Perdiz), although I added many more (Estancia del Puerto, Arcadia, Estrecho, Wasa, Sucre Sale, Raffi, Cafe Bar Tavare, and Rara Avis) to my list, since I am sure I will be back soon.</description>

      <description>We got great gifts for our wedding, but hands down, the best (ever!) is A ROBOT.
My mother-in-law got us a robot. Got that? How cool is that!?
And it is not to make her daughter’s life easier, because I am the one who vacuums at home. She did it because it is cool. Heck yeah it is!
So the Roombais nothing new. It has been around for a decade already.</description>

      <description>We were originally planning on getting married in Valencia (Spain). Bureaucracy made it too hard. So we decided to change our plans, and get married were we got engaged: Niagara Falls!
[Nevertheless, we will still hold a wedding party in Valencia (Spain) for friends and family, at the Westin Hotel, as it was originally planned, but during the last weekend of August]
We flew from New York to Buffalo Thursday, August 1st, at night and drove to my in-laws across the Canada border to spend the night.</description>

      <description>Work has brought me and my friend Alvaro to Texas again. We spent three days in Dallas-Forth Worth and a day in Houston.
Fort Worth (AKA &amp;ldquo;Cow Town&amp;rdquo;) is the 16th most populated city in the USA (and the 5th in Texas). [mudslide:picasa,0,111219615350942087056,5905714281336866337]
We stayed at the Hilton. They have a large breakfast buffet ($9.95), free wifi, kids indoor swimming pool and gym, and a shuttle van that will take you (and pick you up) anywhere within 3 miles.</description>

      <description>The Japan Society CUTS Contemporary Japanese Film Festivalis one of my favorites.
This year we saw four very different but delightful (in their own way) fims, all of them USA premieres and Co-presented with the New York Asian Film Festival:
The Festival Opening Film, with Introduction and Q&amp;amp;A with Director Toshiaki Toyoda, and after film party. Interesting story about death, life, cults&amp;hellip;
Of course, while we were in the area, with so many Japanese restaurants in 47th, we tried:</description>

      <description>This weekend we bought our wedding bands. After an extremely special and personal engagement ring, the wedding bands had to be special too!:
MÖBIUS – a Danish design classic. We bought it at Georg Jensen– 687 Madison Ave., NY.
 The MÖBIUS ring is inspired by geometry, a magnificent example of post-modern innovation. In math, a MÖBIUS is a shape with one surface and one edge (boundary). It is a fluid, infinite shape that inspires reflection.</description>

The good weather means more outdoors. In NYC it means more &amp;ldquo;city&amp;rdquo;, but also &amp;ldquo;more things going on in the city&amp;rdquo;.
This weekend we have walked a lot, and seen quite a few interesting things around town (caveat: I am no expert in NY, although Spanish newspaper Expansion interviewed meabout it last week), like:
 A Chinese-Spanish cuisine restaurant (no, I have no desire to try it any time soon; there are many others higher on my list) Yoga in Bryant Park A looooooong line of police cars going by The Orly Genger art installation at Madison Sq.</description>

      <description>I started my 4th of July&amp;ldquo;celebrations&amp;rdquo; one day early, by visiting the Declaration of Independence &amp;amp; Bill of Rights, handwritten by Thomas Jefferson, exhibited for the first time together, at the NYPL.
 Then, today (4th of July) I went to a protest to demand the restoration of the Fourth Amendment:

      <description>Lately I have been going to the office more than usual. The FDA inspection, then the PILOT health tech NY day (which was held in the coworking space where my office is), and a few other things have made me walk around SoHo quite a lot these days. Here are a few of the surprises I have encountered in the always colorful neighborhood:  The Pearl River Market store, right next door to my offices entrance, is &amp;quot;SoHos best kept secret&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>On April 25th I attended my first FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) Medical Device Establishment Inspection. Agent (Investigator) Kimberley A. Ricketts called me a couple days before to let me know that as a registered medical device manufacturing company, Kanteron Systems (the company I founded in 2005) had been selected for an Establishment Inspection. It was the &amp;ldquo;Notice of Inspection pursuant to Section 704(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act [21 U.</description>

On Tuesday, June 11, and not believing that it had not rained on our trip yet, we asked the hotel for a couple of complimentary bicycles and were told that only one was available but the other one should be available soon. So in the meantime we took the aquabus from the foot of Davie Street in Yaletown to the Public Market on Granville Island, False Creek, where a former industrial site was long ago converted into an indoor public market.</description>

      <description>On May 13th, on my way to a friends apartment, we stumbled upon the set of Ben Stillers new movie right outside the 125th St. subway exit. They were filming in the middle of the street. What struck me the most was that one of the façades of the building had been completely redone (cast, cement, wood, paint&amp;hellip; it looked absolutely real and solid) for the film.
Really? No building façade will do?</description>

May 21st (sorry that is taking me so long to write posts, but unlike what this blog seems to convey, I also do work. A lot) I was invited to a Council Of Protocol Executivesevent India House, New York.
It was a wonderful mix of C-level executives from all kinds of industries (healthcare, advertising, travel, banking&amp;hellip;). A great networking opportunity, with delicious food (seafood risotto, truffle and porcini ricotta, fried oysters, choclate covered strawberries&amp;hellip;).</description>

My friends and family in Valencia have serious doubts that one can eat in the USA as well as in Spain.
Granted, Spain is a foodie`s paradise (by the way, amazing how many of the top 50 restaurants in the worldI have had the pleasure to try, the latest one being Dinner by Heston Blumenthal in London thanks to Stephanie).</description>

On Sunday, after returning to New York from the inaugural cruise, we went to Central Park to spend the afternoon and enjoy Japan Day!
Tents with huge lines to get free Japanese food (udon, okonomiyaki, gyozas, panda chocolate snacks, tea&amp;hellip;), activities (calligraphy, kimonos, origami, yoyo-fishing&amp;hellip;) and performances (karate, taiko&amp;hellip;), all very well organized and full of mostly Japanese people in a very fun and nice event.
There were even so many cosplayers that it reminded me of Jing?</description>

All things must come to an end, so today we sadly had to disembark. After a nice breakfast and a last stroll through the ship, we disembarked very fast and easily, and in a few minutes we were back home in Chelsea (after going through the most absurd and disorganized taxi system I have seen in this country).
What`s my verdict? It is an exceptionally nice ship for a mass market, even considering its gigantic size.</description>

Day 2 of our cruise started waking up to the sound of the waves and with a buffet breakfast at Garden Café, which we took in an outside table.
The day was fully packed of activities, and given my terrible memory, I`m sure I would have forgotten some of them by now. But thanks to the fact that the cruise line gave us access to the net (although only for Twitter, Facebook and Instagram), I was able to tweet my activities, and then use the TL to remember them easier.</description>

      <description>One of the friends having dinner with us yesterdaywas a lawyer that used to be a Public Defender in NY. Of all the many interesting stories she had to tell, one struck me as the perfect example of all that is wrong with The System.
 Once she had to defend a homeless man who was accused of stealing a candy bar from a drugstore. Since he had breached a non-trespass order from a previous similar incident, the prosecutor was asking for a 3 year prison sentence.</description>

      <description>If I go to the office, I complain that there are too many distractions: whether it is the boom-boom music form the downstairs SoHo store, my coworkers playing ping-pong, street art that requires my attention, or the temptation of a Japanese bento box or mochi with tea&amp;hellip;
But if I stay at home, Calvin makes sure I am not as productive as I could be.
OK, I admit it, this was a very silly excuse to try a new slider plugin with Pinterest non-official API&amp;hellip; and trying those things is not a diversion or distraction, is part of my job, I swear!</description>

Luckily the new one will be finished in May, because the old one is falling apart.</description>

I dont like Las Vegas, too flashy, too empty, too superficial... but every time I go, I end up with interesting experiences and observations. Like the devastating effect extreme market capitalism can have on the credibility of institutions (Judge Judys branded slot machine?? WTF!!).</description>

      <description>After MIT`s crazy week, back in NY I needed a couple of days of sleep and relax to get back into the normal rhythm. Luckily it was SuperBowl weekend, so the streets (and Chelsea Market) were fairly empty!
So on Tuesday I was ready to get going full speed ahead. First, after meeting with P. Oberton in the NYPL, then I went to Condé Nast publications` building, into Wired Magazine, to discuss a PR campaign/project along with Valencia Regional Minister of Industry (&amp;amp; etc) Max Buch.</description>

My team (team senZa) choose me to do the presentation of the teams project. We all thought we did an excellent job, and everybody in the room (372) congratulated us. One of the judges even said &amp;quot;it is the best one I have ever seen&amp;quot;. But... lo and behold, we were not selected to the final round. And whats even worst, we received almost no feedback.</description>

After that, lectures by William Aulet, Scott Keating, Paul Maeder, and Antoinette Schoar.
And then&amp;hellip; an all-nighter preparing the group project. Tension, stress, frustration, but in the end a great feeling of accomplishment, and pride in a job well done.</description>

      <description>Day 4 started with a corporate presentation (we got to choose, and I attended the one by Pfizer) at 7:30am, in which Pfizer`s Senior Vice President of Research and Development talked about the rapidly shifting way in which big pharma is working, and mentioned an unacceptable fact that should make us all reflect on how much the patent system is broken:
 Pfizer has 98,000 employees&amp;hellip; and 31,000 lawyers!
 The rest of the day I attended classes by Catherine Tucker, Brian Halligan, and a speech by Dean David Schmittlein.</description>

Snowing, cold, snow, cold&amp;hellip;
Day 2 of the MIT-EDP program has been crazy. Breakfast at 7:00am, classes from 9:00am until 7:00pm, with a lunch break that was actually a lecture too, and two 15 minute breaks in which we were suppose to sign up for company visits, pick up material, etc&amp;hellip;
But it was worth it: William Aulet, and Fiona Murray are excellent lecturers with obviously a lot of experience.</description>

I am here to take the MIT Sloan Executive EducationEDP (Entrepreneurship Development Program).
Getting up at 4 am and braving the fluoutbreakin Boston and the cold weather including a frozen Charles River (not like it is less cold in NY anyway), I arrived from NY this morning in an early flight, and after checking in at the Marriot, I went to a luncheon at the Towne Stove and Spiritsrestaurant sponsored by Ken Morse.</description>

      <description>The second week of January I flew to Lima (Peru) for an important business meeting. It was a hard trip: overnight flight from New York, straight to meeting, and overnight flight back. But there was no other way to fit the trip in my schedule.
A few days later I flew with my fiancée to Valencia both for business and for pleasure.It was a cloudy and &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo; week (for Valencia anyway, because 58ºF could hardly count as &amp;ldquo;cold&amp;rdquo;, considering it is 11ºF now in New York).</description>

December 2nd I flew to Montevideo. I stayed at the Radisson Hotel, Plaza de la Independencia. Very conveniently located with some impressive views from the top floor. Good thing it had a pool, because it is not easy to keep my exercise regime when traveling so much.
Besides very productive meetings with IBM (very nice, professional, and friendly executives, by the way) and presentation to several hospital groups (one of the meetings at the Presidential Building, another one at the country`s largest hospital, and a presentation at the Solis Theater), I enjoyed the promenade by the river which seems like a sea, the old town, and a weird Ice Bar.</description>

      <description>A big band of skaters (I only captured a few in my photograph becuase they were left behind in a stoplight, but there were many many more) rolling down south on Broadway. As they passed, people on the side walk greeted and cheered them. More play and less politics, or the return of the playful society, please. [Update.- there is a big story behind it: the Broadway Bomb] Beecher`s Handmade Cheese, where you can sample and purchase artisanal cheese, have some wine and small apetizers in the cellar downstairs, but even more fun to just sit and watch them make cheese live, through a big glass.</description>

      <description>On Friday I went to NY Comic Con, like everyone else, I guess, with the idea of having fun, of experiencing first hand one of the &amp;ldquo;major events&amp;rdquo; that a true nerdy geek can attend. I also wanted to meet Cory Doctorow (although we actually ended up not meeting). It has been years since I last met him, and it was the perfect &amp;ldquo;excuse&amp;rdquo; to attend the conference.
When I arrived, I was really surprised to see the size of it.</description>

– United Airlines choice of dinner was &amp;quot;beef or chicken&amp;quot;. Whatever happened to the broadly accepted vegetarian-friendly classic pasta choice? Besides, the chicken was breaded, in a white bun, and the &amp;quot;beef&amp;quot;, lets just say it did not look too good.</description>

Moderated by Nan Aron (lecturer, author, and President of Alliance for Justice), the panel consisted of:
 Angelo Falcón: President and Founder of the National Institute for Latino Policy Keesha Gaskins: Senior Counsel in the Brennan Center`s Democracy Program Lawrence Lessig: Professor of Law at Harvard University (and much more) John Samples: Director of the Cato Institute Center for Representative Government  The discussion was quite interesting.</description>

      <description>Before I forget more (I am sure I am leaving out a lot), here is a little recap of things I`ve done, tried, or discovered in NY during July:
July 1st I went to Strand, my favorite bookstore, with its cool graffiti outside.
and then went to the &amp;ldquo;Exquisite Corpses: Drawing and Disfiguration&amp;rdquo; Party at the MoMA with Nebula.

The famous &amp;quot;Sunscreen&amp;rdquo; music video(the text comes from an essaywritten in 1997 by Mary Schmich, a columnist at the Chicago Tribune, as a graduation speech for the class of `97) which gives some amazing advice for life. There is even a StarWars Version.

      <description>After reading &amp;ldquo;Debunking Putin`s Newest Myth&amp;rdquo; by Alexander Yanov, PhD, and with all my respect and admiration for this very well known historian of Russian nationalisms:
Although quite brilliant and eloquent, I believe it is not incisive and daring enough in debunking Putin`s newest myth. It takes a very conservative approach, perhaps letting a Western traditional philosophy baggage and inclination take the part of pure reason and belief, which is usually needed, in equal parts, to fight a political/philosophical quarrel.</description>

      <title>Two June weeks in NY</title>

      <description>In a sort of &amp;ldquo;NY diary&amp;rdquo;, here is what the last two weeks of June had in store for me.
 June 17th:  I went to Cha`Anin the heart of the East Village, for a very delicious tea ceremony. And it was delicious not just because of the great matcha tea (usucha) and wagashi, but also because Noriko-san was such an excellent host, performing an excellent otemae. Being a public restaurant, and not a private house, not everything was &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo;, like in the tokonoma, where the scroll was obviously generic.</description>

      <description>Trying to catch up with fun days, here is what June 1st looked like: first some crêpes for lunch at Vive La CrepeUnion Square (delicious crêpes and funny chair backs embedded in concrete).
Then, after browsing around at Beacons Closet&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, and going to &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;httpss://www.tibethouse.us/&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;httpss://www.tibethouse.us/&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Tibet House&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to gather info (Tuesdays meditation classes, here I go), it was finally time to visit Rubin Museum of Art. While Modernist Art from India, Illuminated, and Casting the Divine were very interesting and delightful, I must admit the nerdy geek in me enjoyed Hero, Villain, Yeti like a real kid.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I received my new Lytrocamera. Although it is an incredible technology, and allows things that were unthinkable until now, so far I am mixed.
Pros:
 Compact and discreet Extremely easy to use New ways of taking pictures Novelty Supercool &amp;ldquo;focus later&amp;rdquo;  Cons:
 You have to get used to a different way of thinking and framing a shot (square! and distance) Low performance under low light (although better than my crappy Samsung Galaxy IIS camera)  Check out this online gallery.</description>

      <description>On Friday I went to the MET, and took a tour of their &amp;ldquo;highlights&amp;rdquo; with a curator, stopping at a few particularly interesting pieces in their collection. Here are some of them, and what makes them particularly interesting:
 In the Greek/Roman hall, the sculpture of fabric: while the greek sculptors portrayed the idealized human figure (even turning it into a mathematical formula) and the romans followed that tradition, fabric was the only part that was sculpted as it was, from thick to almost transparent, with embroidery, motifs, etc.</description>

      <description>After posting graphs and cold data (quite ilustrative, I believe), and the discussion it has generated (people, why don`t you use the &amp;ldquo;comment&amp;rdquo; instead all the other unstructured methods you are using?), please let me write a caveat about graphs and cold data.
In my high-tech gym, you have the option to have a lot of data collected, for your own, private and personal use. It seems like a great idea at first.</description>

 Author and curator Raul Zamudioin conversation with Mookie Tenembaum.
Please join us at White Boxfor the closing reception of DISILLUSIONISM, and to engage in a stimulating conversation between Raul Zamudio and Mookie Tenembaum at 8pm sharp. Mookie will be presenting his new artist book, Paranoia. Malbec wines and truffles will be served.
 Although I am grateful for the invitation, and it sure was an interesting event, some things just beg to be commented.</description>

      <description>On Saturday morning, as I was walking towards the gym on Park Avenue, I saw waves of young adults (although acting like teenagers or frat boys) wearing green (some just a t-shirt or sweater, some a full leprechaun costume) on a procession towards their favorite Irish watering hole to &amp;ldquo;celebrate&amp;rdquo; St. Patricks Day in the only way that they seem to believe to be appropriate, besides a 5th Ave. official parade: drink until you pass out.</description>

 Do you have a mental or physical disorder that poses or is likely to pose a threat to the safety or welfare of yourself or others? Are you or have you ever been a drug abuser or addict? Have you ever violated, or engaged in a conspiracy to violate, any law relating to controlled substances?</description>

      <description>The net was all up in arms this week. After the marvelous uprising against SOPA and PIPA, the new battle ground was Twitter`s announcement of country specific censorship. Never mind that they are open about it (unlike Facebook), never mind that they are talking about their offices and employees in those countries where censorship is the law&amp;hellip; if you hear &amp;ldquo;censorship&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;net&amp;rdquo; get up and scream!

      <description>Last week I went to 3 exhibitions/events that have allowed me to see the importance of context in the interpretation (and enjoyment) of a work of art. Note that I differentiate &amp;ldquo;interpretation&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;enjoyment&amp;rdquo;, although for many of us, those two concepts go hand in hand. But this is just a short post, so the Phenomenological Aesthetics will have to wait (you can read Dewey, Hartmann, Adorno, Ortega y Gasset, Sartre, etc, etc in the meantime 😉 )</description>

      <title>Culture in today`s world in a state of polarized anomie</title>

      <description>When Émile Durkheim wrote on the concept of anomie (expanding on Jean-Marie Guyau`s work) in his 1897 book Suicide, he spoke of one end of anomie: a society with too much rigidity and little individual discretion causing a destructive mismatch (moral deregulation and an absence of legitimate aspirations).
This is happening in the XXI century world, in many countries: those totalitarian (military or religious) societies where the social rule, expectations, and repression conform a cage around individuals, deposessing them of their individuality, their aspirations, subtly (or otherwise) imposing a social corset where the individual can not be itself, concentrating only on breathing, surviving.</description>

      <description>As I walk towards my office, I see an ad that makes me sick (as a matter of fact, I see many, but this one points to something other that the consumerism-sexism-excess that we are so dangerously getting used to).
The ad says &amp;ldquo;Turn now into memories&amp;rdquo;. How wrong is that?!!
Now is now. Now has to be now. Now should be now. Now has to remain now.
When you strive to &amp;ldquo;turn now into memories&amp;rdquo;, you are missing out on the real now.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, along a MeetUp group, we visited several art galleries in Chelsea (NY): Mike Weiss Gallery, Gladstone Gallery, Luhring Augustine Gallery, Metro Pictures Gallery, The Pace Gallery, and Mary Boone Gallery.
Leaving my personal comments on the displayed works aside (as usual, the pleasure of this kind of pilgrimage is to leave your mind and senses open, and let the works and stimuli slowly sink in), one thing surprised me quite a lot: Ai Wei Wei‘s work Sunflower Seeds was supposed to be walked on (at least it did at the Tate Modern in London, for the first 10 days of the exhibit), but at Mary Boone Gallerythere is a security guard that prevents visitors from doing exactly what the artist intended.</description>

      <description>My friend Victoria Contreras is a real Renaissance artist, what we would call today a hacker artist: one that explores different media, different methods, different interest, in a bold, almost childishly uninhibited playful way. While the influences are obvious, and not everything is on the same level (as is always the case in those who try it all), this is what I would call &amp;ldquo;a case of interesting people&amp;rdquo;.

      <description>Today, at the gym`s lobby/reception area, a man was sitting waiting for his wife to come out of yoga class. When she does, he gets up to greet her, feels dizzy, and passes out, falling to the ground, and hitting his face on the floor.
Two men who were on their way out, walk over this man. They do not bother-care-ask what`s wrong. They do not offer assistance.
Finally, his wife (who witnessed the whole episode, paralyzed in fear) reacts, wakes him up, and makes sure his eye socket bleeding is not too profuse.</description>

A &amp;ldquo;horsehead&amp;rdquo; in the NY subway. What I love (and sometimes hate) about NY: nobody turned, laughed, commented, got scared, pointed a finger&amp;hellip; this is life as usual here.
&amp;ldquo;The Crazy Piano Guy&amp;rdquo; is Colin Huggins, a piano player that takes his piano to Madison Square Park and performs in public for free. Awesome.

      <title>Color associations: red and yellow</title>

      <description>Seeing certain color combinations, associations are sure to fly into anybody`s minds.
Usually, red and yellow will bring to mind things like flags (of Spain, Catalonia-Valencia, R, Security, and adding some shapes you could even think of Macedonia or China).
Beyond flags, Axomil, sunset, fire, peppers,tullips, ballons, ketchup and mustard, Flash, soccer referee cards, Superman&amp;hellip; there are SO many options.
But when you consider the hue, tone, context, memory, and further additional information, then those options start to get reduced.</description>

      <description>Although I like more &amp;ldquo;spiritual&amp;rdquo; martial arts, I had always wanted to try boxing (one of the few martial arts I had not tried yet). So today I had my first boxing session with Curtis Summit. Who is Curtis? This is his official short bio:
 Former professional boxer with 20 years of boxing experience who turned Pro in 1983 after advancing to the 1984 Olympics box off. With 26-9-2 pro records, 14TKOs on the national and international level, ranked No 2 in the world by the World Boxing Council, the World Boxing Association and the International Boxing Federation.</description>

      <description>See in Scientific American:
 &amp;ldquo;I could not survive without a ballpoint pen in my back pocket. It`s invaluable for scribbling notes on the front of my hand (my version of the PalmPilot&amp;hellip;) to remind me to do things I used to be able to remember unaided before my age converged with my IQ while traveling in opposite directions.&amp;rdquo;

      <title>Culinary curiosities in NY</title>

      <description>In Dean &amp;amp; Delucayou can find the most exquisite culinary treats (most from Europe, of course). And while there are so many to choose from a foodie like me could not make his mind up in a hundred years, I must admit the cuteness of this snowman-cake won me over:
On the other hand, even when one sticks to very healthy vegetarian (mostly vegan, sometimes macrobiotic, but always with the exception of sushi) diet, it seems impossible to scape the &amp;ldquo;over-spiced&amp;rdquo; cooking in the US.</description>

      <description>The world around us is full of signs. I wont go on dabble about _signifiers_, _meanings_, and the psychoanalitycal importance of the _word_. But sometimes I just cant help myself, when I see a sign begging for a creative interpretation:
Cmon, dont tell me you don`t see something like:
 If you press this button, your mouth will become a hotspot
 or
 A giant asteroid is heading towards your SpaceInvaders spacecraft, push the button to destroy the asteroid with a Dune-sque voice-blast</description>

      <description>Of course, the first year living in NY, new year`s eve party HAD to include a peregrination to Times Square. And since we had tickets to the Iridium concert(the Mike Stern Band featuring Randy Brecker, John Patitucci &amp;amp; Dave Weckl), we figured we would get a taste of it taking the subway to 42nd/Times Square (since police closed the nearer 50th st station)&amp;hellip; and did we indeed!!
The Broadway/42nd intersection was incredibly packed.</description>

      <title>The Uncanny Valley as an approach to the pseudo-empathy of Aperger Syndrome</title>

      <description>According to Wikipedia:
 The uncanny valley is a hypothesis in the field of robotics and 3D computer animation, which holds that when human replicas look and act almost, but not perfectly, like actual human beings, it causes a response of revulsion among human observers. The &amp;ldquo;valley&amp;rdquo; in question is a dip in a proposed graph of the positivity of human reaction as a function of a robot`s human likeness.</description>

      <description>I hate charitable dinners where most (or almost all) of the money goes to caviar, tuxedos, valet parking and other hoopla.
Fortunately there are other charitable dinners, where you wont see any &amp;lt;a title=&amp;quot;httpss://www.escolar.net/MT/archives/2011/11/la-nueva-politica-de-igualdad.html&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;httpss://www.escolar.net/MT/archives/2011/11/la-nueva-politica-de-igualdad.html&amp;quot; target=&amp;quot;_blank&amp;quot;&amp;gt;PP mothers&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, like yesterdays organized by Didi, where people sit on the floor, eat off plastic plates, and enjoy Didis deliciously vegan cooking and sincere love, so just about all money collected goes to Calcuttas orphans.</description>

      <description>First things first: thanks to whomever thought I would be interested in joining MCAthrough RiseUp, BUT&amp;hellip;
 Don`t subscribe me to a list without my consent Don`t do so without at least letting me know who you are Don`t assume I might be interested in something because it sounds related to my interest Don`t align me with &amp;ldquo;scientific socialism&amp;rdquo; when I am a declared anarchist Don`t make me waste my time on a list where the first 20 or so messages are split between arguing troskist, marxist, rose of lenburguist, bujarinist, bakuninist, leninist, hotsiminist, guevarist, maoist, castrist&amp;hellip; and people who want to be taken off the list  So, thanks (and I show it by talking about your project here), but show a little respect for other people`s rights, please.</description>

      <title>OCW: Art in Spanish</title>

      <description>I have been interested in OCW (Open CourseWare) since the year 2000, when I tried to convince Polytechnic University of Valencia to upload all materials and lectures from the Master`s Degree (where I was lecturing) to the web for anyone to access.
Although quite slowly, OCW has come a long way. Years ago MIT and some others made a strong commitment for the OCW. But it has taken Spanish universities years to wake up and start to follow that lead.</description>
