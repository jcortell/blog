      <description>It has been a while since I wrote a tutorial to Share The Wealth, so it’s about time I shared some practical (if basic) knowledge beyond reposting a link.
For years I have had a pet project in the backburner: I wanted to create presentations without the need of dedicated software, commercial (like PowerPoint or Keynote), or free (like LibreOffice or OpenOffice). That way I could avoid bringing my computer to a lecture, and not worry about what computer system would be available in the auditorium.</description>

      <title>A little over 24 hours in Peru</title>

      <description>On Sunday I left London to go to Peru for a business trip. I was connecting in Madrid but, due to a 4-hour delay in the departure of the flight, I missed my red-eye connection to Lima.
Fortunately, European Union regulations mandate that airlines feed and provide shelter to stranded passengers (subject to some conditions), unlike in the USA, where the same unfortunate circumstance is usually the passengers’ problem. So Iberia gave me a voucher for a dinner, a breakfast, a hotel night in a nearby hotel, two phone calls and the transfer to and from the hotel.</description>

      <description>February 18 to 23 I traveled to Orlando, Florida (USA) for the HIMSS trade show. As much as I have enjoyed the magic of Orlando parks in the past, this was a pure business trip. I am an EU citizen (Spain) living in the UK, and I took a direct flight from London to Orlando. I had recently renewed my passport and ESTA, so I should be able to enter the USA without a problem right?</description>

      <description>Tuesday, March 31 and Wednesday, February 1 I went to Brussels by train. It is sad to see the permanent heavy military presence around Brussels main train station.
Microsoft had invited me to participate in the ‘Health Digital Transformation at the Microsoft Executive Briefing Center, because my company is a founding member of the ‘AI in Health Partner Alliance (along with Microsoft and 20 other tech companies) which was launched at the event.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I went with my wife and son to visit the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert`s Museum exhibition You Say You Want a Revolution? Records and Rebels 1966-1970. The aim of the exhibition was quite clear:
 How have the finished and unfinished revolutions of the late 1960s changed the way we live today and think about the future?
 I was very much looking forward to visiting the exhibition. It is SO timely, and SO needed, I thought.</description>

      <description>For reasons beyond the scope of this post I was invited to participate in the UK-China Hi! Technology event in London.
The event was well attended by a large number of entrepreneurs, funds and investors from the UK and China.
The highlight of the event, for me, other than a couple of really interesting contacts, was to see all these suited-up people lining up to try the VR sets (HTC, Oculus, Hololens, etc).</description>

      <description>Most people I know would not consider protein structure analysis of mutations causing inheritable diseases &amp;ldquo;spare time fun&amp;rdquo;. Then again, most people I know don`t think I am like most people they know.
This week I`m a &amp;ldquo;single-dad&amp;rdquo;, since my wife is traveling. So my spare time right now is almost non existent. Nevertheless, the thought of mutating a Proline into a Glycine at position 22 intrigued me, so I spent a few minutes simulating it.</description>

      <description>Adam Gilfix, Brian de Luna, and Luke Heine, with the help of Dealroom.co, have created a very interesting data visualization tool for Venture Capital (VC) flows.
I know for a fact and from experience that VC activity in places like Silicon Valley, NY, Boston, or London is big. But even when I go back home (Valencia – Spain) for the holidays, there are all kinds of &amp;ldquo;VC&amp;rdquo; events, news, meetings, spaces&amp;hellip; which, given the conservative and provincial nature of the &amp;ldquo;Valencian Investors&amp;rdquo; I have met, surprises me.</description>

      <description>Right after I returned from Germany, and before departing for Paraguay, I was invited to speak at the GIANT Health event(the “global innovation and new technology health event), health in The Coronet, London.
The event run for 3 days, November 16-18, with 3 parallel tracks, and it included over 200 speakers. I spoke November 18, in the main auditorium.
There was an exhibition area, with several companies and organizations showing their innovations and technologies.</description>

      <description>For second consecutive year, my company has been named “Top Scaleup in the UK”. This means that we are growing fast, and also that I get invited to cool events. One of those events was a reception and a ‘Ten Years From Now’ series of keynotes at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, another one a mentoring session at London’s City Hall, and another one a series of talks at Google Campus.</description>

      <description>November 1 I attended Future Decoded, the annual event where Microsoft and Partners present their forward looking products and concepts.
Besides some cool “event attractions” (like the Back To The Future Delorean, seeing how data is not completely deleted even if you deep freeze a hard drive, the Bloodhound record-breaking car, or seeing the inside of a Rolls Royce plane turbine), the key for me was to be able to demonstrate my company’s software running on an amazing 84” Microsoft Surface Hub, and attending the invitation-only Microsoft Executive Party at the Sunborn Yacht Hotel.</description>

      <description>The last couple of weeks in October I went to Valencia to attend the Digital Health Venture Forum, where I received the Best Presentation Award.
After spending a few days with my family and my Spanish team, and participating in an art installation by the SuperFlex collective on the 25th, I returned to London.
October 27 I went to the beautiful Oxford Science Park to have a couple of business meetings.</description>

      <description>The last few days have been quite hectic. So much so that I`m going to &amp;ldquo;bundle&amp;rdquo; them into one or two very heterogeneous posts.
By the end of September I had to attend a few events, like being invited to a member of Microsoft`s Partner Advisory Council (we held the first meeting at the InterContinental London Park Lane Hotel), or an E2E networking dinner at Charlotte Street Hotel:
Tuesday October 4 I travelled to Paris to meet a South American Vice-minister of Health in IBM France:</description>

      <description>Tuesday, October 11th, was day four, and last, at the Exponential Medicine Conference in San Diego.

      <description>Monday, October 10th, I had the pleasure to have a chat with Peter Diamandis at a coffee (tea for me, thank you) break.
He was very interested in talking about my company (Kanteron Systems), as we have developed technology that can really help some of his investments in Precision Medicine and Longevity.
Even more interesting than talking about investments, it was to know a little bit the man behind the legend.</description>

      <description>Saturday, October 8th, I attended day 1 of the Singularity University Exponential Medicine Conference in San Diegoat the amazing Hotel Del Coronado.
The event was organized mainly by Will Weisman and the incomparable Daniel Kraft, MD (whom I met last year at the London Stock Exchange), both from Singularity University.
The Conference was fully packed with activities. Morning activities started at 7am and included Yoga, Meditation, Art, and Beach Run. Evening activities changed every day, and included things like Team Collaboration &amp;amp; Innovation Games, Gadget &amp;amp; S’mores Bar, Music &amp;amp; Magic at the Bar, UnConference, or Silent Disco.</description>

      <description>Friday, September 16, I attended 3 &amp;ldquo;bilateral meetings&amp;rdquo;.The first one took place in downtown San Francisco, in Uber HQ.
The first one took place in downtown San Francisco, in Uber, which is in the same building as Square and across the street from Twitter.
That same morning there was a big story about how much money Uber is losing, and how artificially high their valuation is, but of course, nobody wanted to talk about that.</description>

      <description>Thursday, September 15 I had several meetings in Silicon Valley.
The first one was with the Director of Strategic Investments at the Microsoft Technology Center in Mountain View. Since it is business related, I won`t comment anything about that very interesting meeting.
The second one was with a Partner at Google Ventures. The discussion was to the point and provocative. It is interesting to note that Google and Google Ventures are NOT the same company.</description>

      <description>On September 13, Mind the Bridge hosted a policy hackathon sponsored by Dell at the MTB Innovation Center in San Francisco. The Dell PolicyHack™ brought together entrepreneurs and U.S./EU policy experts to solve policy challenges. The goal is to productively brainstorm and to provide top-line thinking that can inspire and serve as basis to develop and implement full policies.
My team was formed by:
 Sara R. Klucking (Section Chief, Innovation &amp;amp; Programs, Office of Science and Technology Cooperation, US Department of State) Bogdan Ceobanu (Policy Officer, Startups &amp;amp; Innovation, European Commission) David Hodgson (CEO, Hummingbird Labs) me  The five teams had 75 minutes to come up with a policy solution to issue areas that impact entrepreneurs.</description>

      <description>Tuesday September 13 was a day devoted to workshops, a policy hackathon, and a visit to Pinterest HQ.
As I have mentioned before, we have been fortunate to have a great group of mentors. In this case we enjoyed the following sessions in small groups:
 Market growth with: the CEO of CorkBIC, a former Microsoft BizDev VP, and the co-Founder &amp;amp; Director of Blippar Funding with: the Chair of Global Venture Forum, a Director at Woodside Capital, and a Partner at Delta Partners Group M&amp;amp;A/IPO with: the Principal M&amp;amp;A Integration at Google, a Managing Partner at Woodside Capital, and a Partner at Penningtons Manches Communication/PR with: the President of ActiveMedia, and the Associate Director at Oxygen PR  After that we had a policy hackathon competition (more about that in the next blog post).</description>

      <description>Monday, September 12, was the European Innovation Day (EID)at the Computer History Museumin Mountain View, CA.
Although the museum is not open on Mondays, we had access to a few of the exhibits, like the one about the IBM 1401, the awesome PDP-1 (Creating the Hacker Culture), and autonomous vehicles (and yes, of course, I go into a Google driverless car, and took a selfie).
But the reason why we went there was not (only) to see the museum but to participate in the EID event.</description>

      <description>One of the things that strikes me the most in this trip is how many homeless there are in SF. The income inequality is so obvious and insulting, it hurts. I know this is not a “SF-only” problem, but here it is a lot more visible than in many other cities.
As I walk from Union Sq. to Tender Nob through Geary or O’Farrell streets, or as I go to work in SOMA, I see homeless and people in need all over the sidewalk.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday August 9th, I was invited to talk about Personalised Medicine at Microsoft’s event “Empowering Health in a mobile first and cloud first world”, at Microsoft’s UK headquarters in Reading (UK).
There were very interesting sessions on Intelligent Cloud, Microsoft Research (with whom we are collaborating) work on radiology and genomics, Introduction to productivity in health, Revolutionising infection control, National Technology Officer’s Cloud Update, Transdermal Sensors in Paediatric Care, Introduction to personalised computing in health, Virtual care clinics in Sweden, Digital wellbeing, The venture programme for health, NHS…</description>

      <description>I am interested in many things. One of the main ones is technology. And within technology, software development to view telemetry data in different ways, within the same application.
Answering NASA’s call to help contribute to the exploration of the solar system, I got access to their next-generation mission control framework being developed at the NASA Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley being used for mission planning and operations in the lead up to the Resource Prospector mission, and at NASA`s Jet Propulsion Laboratory to view data from the Curiosity Rover.</description>

      <description>After the trip to Boston I came down with the flu, of course on a weekend as usual. So Monday I had zero energy, but a week ahead with an usual large number of meetings around London, so I had to do “magic calendar tricks” to be able to make all of them and to also attend several events. The main “trick” is to concentrate meetings geographically, adding into the calendar the time it takes to go from point A to point B.</description>

      <description>On Wednesday and Thursday, I was invited to attend the Amazon Web Services Summit in London’s Excel center.
Besides an exhibition area with many vendors (some of them already suppliers to my company) like NewRelic, DataDog, GitHub, Chef, Alscient, Teradici, DataPipe, Ruxit, CloudCheckr, Amazon Activate, Elastic, Redis, etc, all with their great swag (mostly t-shirts and stickers, but lots of giveaways, from drones to iWatches), the highlight was the conference sessions.</description>

      <description>During my flight to Boston I read “Regenesis”, the interesting genomic science book by Professor George Church, which was a gift from my friend Dr. Raminderpal Singh.
On Wednesday evening I had a very interesting conversation in Boston with both of them. Neither of them needs an introduction in the genomics world, but for those of you outside the field:
 Raminder is Vice-president at Eagle Genomics and Advisor at Kanteron Systems.</description>

      <description>June 28 and 29 I attended, along with my friend John Memarian, President &amp;amp; CCO of my company Kanteron Systems, the Festival of Genomics Boston, as a Microsoft Genomics Group partner.
Although the show was small, it was a great opportunity to network with industry and academic experts (from Harvard Professors to Illumina executives) and learn.
From scientific posters to the latest sequencing technologies, from robotic arms to genomics experiments in space, it was great #geekfun.</description>

      <description>For Father’s Day (we live in London, so we celebrate it today, unlike in Spain which is March 19) my wife gave me the “Ultimate Father`s Day” gift, from TechCamp UK. [Thank you, love!]
It consisted of a workshop with other father-son / father-daughter “teams”, held at the Iron Yard (The Leathermarket – London), where we built a desktop arcade machine in 5 hours (including lunch break), following the directions from Tom and Tom, using the Picadeset, setting up and using the Raspberry Pi, custom OS, emulators, ROMs, loudspeakers, power supply, LCD screen, etc:</description>

      <description>Today I was invited to attend InfoSecurity Europe, Europe`s largest Information Security industry event.
As always, it was interesting to have a chance to catch up with this rapidly moving field, and a great opportunity to chat with old friends.
Apart from gimmicks (VR everywhere, car racing and helicopter simulators, giant robots, etc), swag (all kinds of Star Wars and other Sci-Fi related giveaways, from toys to t-shirts) and junk food (from candy to icecream to chips, the booths did not have healthy alternatives, although the food vendors did), the most interesting part of these events is always the talks, specifically the hands-on demos.</description>

      <description>Today I was invited, along with my son, who at 14 has been a videogame developer for years, to attend the Intel Buzz videogame developer workshop. It was not only a lot of fun, but WONDERFUL to attend with him!
Although a small event, it ended up being extremely interesting, with an area to try indie games and new technologies, and a long list of talks and panels, including one-on-ones.</description>

      <description>May 27 I was invited to participate in the “Computing in Cancer Workshop” organized by Microsoft Research in Cambridge.
It was a great opportunity to network, meet with colleagues and other researchers, and especially to learn a lot.
The fascinating lectures were:
 Antonio Criminisi (Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research): Machine Learning for Medical Image Analysis Jasmin Fisher (Senior Researcher, Microsoft Research): Virtual Models of Cancer Giles Maskell (President, Royal College of Radiologists): Current problems in diagnostic radiology Fiona Gilbert (Head of the Department of Radiology, University of Cambridge) Dennis Wang (Senior Bioinformatics Scientist, AstraZeneca): Predicting drug combinations and biomarkers of response: a crowd-sourced solution Florian Markowetz (University of Cambridge, CRUK Cambridge Institute): Quantifying patterns of tumour evolution Francesca Buffa (Associate Professor, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford): In-silico systems biology and functional genomics approaches to accelerate biomarker discovery Hoifung Poon (Researcher, Microsoft Research): Machine Reading for Cancer Panomics Raj Jena (Academic Consultant Clinical Oncologist, Cambridge University Hospitals): Computing for Radiation Oncology – from cell culture to the clinic Bertie Gottgens (Professor of Molecular Haematology, University of Cambridge): Defining Cell States and Regulatory Networks using Single Cell Genomics  </description>

      <description>The weekend of February 27 and 28 I set up my first art exhibition as Independent International Art Curator.
In collaboration with the Internet Freedom Festival, held in Las Naves (Valencia) from 2 to 6 March, Net Freedom Art Showis an international, itinerant, collective and multidisciplinary contemporary art show. After its debut in Valencia, it will be exhibited in galleries around the world (New York, London, Santiago de Chile, and Kaunas).</description>

      <description>Tuesday March 1 I had a conversation with Dr. DJ Patil, the First White House Chief Data Scientist, at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas.
He was interested in discussing ways in which the White House can help healthcare technology companies like mine. The first issue I raised was my concern over the FBI’s request for Apple to decrypt a suspected criminal’s iPhone.
My position in this issue is well known: weak encryption means weak security for ALL of us, so nobody can request weak security for security’s sake.</description>

      <description>On February 25 a group of medical imaging researchers from Microsoft came to our company’s headquarters in Valencia (Spain) for a day-long workshop on bleeding edge medical image software.
I must admit that just a few years ago I would have laughed at the idea of such an occurrence for many reasons. But things change, and now Microsoft is much more open (and convinced) about Open Source software, their researchers have demonstrated exceptional ability in advanced medical imaging analysis algorithms (unlike their failed business strategy around Amalga), and my company has grown and innovated to the point where it captures the interest and even enthusiasm of some of the largest technology companies in the world.</description>

      <description>Yesterday we went to see a couple exhibitions at Somerset House, in London.
The first exhibition we saw was “TINTIN: Hergé`s Masterpiece”. Basic but obviously appealing, it was too crowded to be enjoyable.
The second one was “Big Bang Data”.
While undoubtedly interesting, especially for someone who works in, teaches, and loves bid data and technology like myself, to me the most interesting aspect of this exhibition is that everyone who was there had already experienced the subject.</description>

      <description>I spent Wednesday evening and most of Thursday in Zürich.
On Wednesday I had dinner with some business partners; “business as usual”.
But on Thursday, after my business presentation to potential customers, I had the very rare and exclusive opportunity to visit one of the main data centers in Switzerland. Here are some impressive facts about them:
 they host 1/3 of Swiss banks data internet traffic = 40% of Switzerland’s internet traffic energy bill = 2 million Swiss Franks per annum 2 different energy suppliers from 2 different access points, with preferential oil supply in case of a failure (full reserves for 5 days for the generators) almost 50 telecoms suppliers, from many different countries, providing direct access for their customers worldwide RFIDs paired with 3D fingerprint scanners which measure the fingerprint but also the morphology, pulse and temperature separate isolated room to open packages, to minimize the risk of fire single person magnetic doors temperature, movement, and sound sensors double-gated entrance even to the parking lot!</description>

      <description>These past few days have been quite “playful”.
On the one hand, I have just discovered, right around the corner from our apartment by London Bridge, a free and public playground that has an artificial grass hockey field, half a basketball court, 3 pingpong tables and even a beach volleyball court with sand and all! So obviously, the next day I went with my son to a sports equipment store and bought a soccer ball, a pingpong set, a basketball, a volleyball and a badminton set.</description>

It was quite a shock comparing the overall tone and spirit to the same event in New York, last year.
In New York everything was oriented toward networking, and you had the feeling that anyone could be anyone, and it didn`t matter if they represented a large company or a &amp;ldquo;start-up wannabe&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Besides your typical mix of VIPs, politicians, and media, the most outstanding thing was the view 😉
You can read the details of the press release here.
PS.- Some constructive criticism:
 In an event like this &amp;ldquo;Technology&amp;hellip; whatever&amp;rdquo; you need a hashtag (something like #LTW15) A Technology Week is full of events, how about a MAP, CALENDAR, or an APP to show them all, and to sign up?</description>

      <description>On Thursday, June 11 I attended the London New Tech Meeting at Google Campus.
It was a typical presentation format (5 companies, 5 minutes). I enjoyed some of the presentations, specially since two of the projects sounded very very promising. Unfortunately they were not even MVP with a landing page. I hope they make it so we can all benefit from their cool ideas.
Since it was a nice day, on my way back home I noticed how the typical beer-drinking crowd had multiplied by hundreds, and they were all drinking and being cheerly loud out on the streets.</description>

First of all, let me congratulate the savvy business and marketing team behind it. They put together a well though-out package, their idea is unique and very interesting: a videogame that will reward players by sending them real gold + investors buying &amp;ldquo;mines&amp;rdquo; in the game and participating in the profits.</description>

      <description>I have been working at the Google-TechHub Campus in Shoreditch (the “Silicon Roundabout”) London for a few weeks. It is really cool. In no particular order, here are some things I love about this place:
 A cafeteria (open to anyone) with terrace, foosball table, bitcoin machine, device bar (to test your developments in many different devices) and even a spacesuit! A small but well stocked library of tech books Very nice team, from security to reception, to admin, to social media… all of them Two levels of office space, one of them (supposedly) “quiet zone” Unlimited supplies of toast and tea, great wifi, and good scanners/printers A ton of areas to sit down and have a meeting, not just the “meeting rooms” Most importantly: the events.</description>

      <description>This past winter I met Sandy and James from Open ITP in New York, and Pepe from Valencia. They were organizing the Circumvention Tech Festivalto be held in Las Naves, Valencia (Spain) March 1-6.
They invited me to give a talk, which was eventually scheduled for March 4th at 3pm. I titled the talk “When privacy does not mean the same to you and me”. It was meant to generate debate, to expose other people’s points of view, rather than to be a unidirectional speech.</description>

      <description>Iban M. G. and Ben Martin have launched a writing project that breaks the boundaries of typical book in paper/digital format. Over the years I have seen many attempts to push the publishing world further. All commendable and appreciated. But so far I have not seen any project as ambitious as HTO.
Note: Literary review aside. I have not read the novel yet and, as a matter of fact, that`s irrelevant for the purposes of this post.</description>

      <description>Due to the launch of the biosensors module for my company`s medical imaging and data solution a few days ago, the Withings company sent me a biosensor (wearable) Withings Pulse Ox, manometer BPM and WiFi WS-30 scale for testing and integration tests ahead of some national projects we are about to sign in London and Santiago de Chile.
All three came in luxury packaging, and were relatively easy to connect and set up, at least for a &amp;ldquo;tinkerer&amp;rdquo; (there are people who gets annoyed if I use &amp;ldquo;hacker&amp;rdquo; as a synonym, although it is) like me.</description>

      <description>I have just bought a OnePlusOne phone, and have been using it for a couple of days. Let me tell you: it`s AMAZING.
If you have never heard of the company, dont worry, youre not alone. But you should definitely check it out, because their phones are incredibly high quality, high specs, and low price (mine was $349). No catch:

      <description>Last Thursday I met with executives from Dell in the Dell Solution Center in New York to explore potential collaborations between my company and Dell.
Funny how large companies have adopted this system of offices / &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; centers to make presentations to clients spread across major cities in the world. With telecommuting gaining ground but face to face still being something fundamental in business, it makes much more sense than it seems.</description>

      <description>A couple weeks ago I was at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. Of course, when I arrive in an airport with enough time ahead of my boarding, I look for a plug and wifi. Luckily Schiphol is an excellent airport, offering both. The only problem is that every time I clicked on the &amp;ldquo;Enjoy unlimited free wifi – Connect&amp;rdquo; button, I got an &amp;ldquo;Unknown error 0&amp;rdquo; message back.
 Don`t tell me &amp;ldquo;Enjoy unlimited free wifi&amp;rdquo; and then try to prevent me from accessing it.</description>

It was an interesting meeting, attended by 15 business executives, investors and analysts. Not only they were all very smart, but I was brain dead after the long red-eye flight.</description>

      <description>Last Wednesday I participated in IBM’s Federal Summit at the Ronald Reagan Federal Building in Washington DC.
Business aside, it was one scary meeting. There were control systems all over. From the IRS to airports, to National Security, the demos were much more advanced and comprehensive than anything you may have seen in a movie. Big Brother to the Nth degree. They know it all about you. In a second. You either get paranoid-serious about security, encryption and privacy, or you might as well forget completely about your privacy.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I started learning and experimenting with quantum computing programming. Its not easy to express the fun and excitement that experience brought me, but Ill try:
Programming a quantum computer is different than programming a binary (0 and 1) &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; computer. To program a quantum system, you have to map a problem into a search for the “lowest point&amp;rdquo; in a very large pool of options, which corresponds to the best possible outcome.</description>

The event allowed me to meet very interesting people, and visiting the Barcelona Supercomputing Center(with its Mare Nostrum supercomputer, in the most amazing set-up you could even imagine) and the Barcelona Scientific Park.</description>

Besides the interesting new features (here are the videos), and the delicious and healthy lunch buffet, I networked quite a lot, and had a few laughs about the highest concentration of Google Glasses per person I have seen so far. One thing is clear: genomics, which is one of the main things my two companies deal with, and the cloud, are closely related, and they will be even more in the near future.</description>

It was a late night meeting, on the 54th floor of the still under construction World Trade Center. The reason why the meeting took place there is because the IBM team was finishing the set up of the next day’s Watson presentation.

So, tired of waiting, I have found a quick and simple hack to make it work with the latests WP 3.8 update: edit qtranslate.php to
 define(‘QT_SUPPORTED_WP_VERSION, ‘3.8);
 You`re welcome 😉</description>

      <description>In a single word: security.
By now there is no doubt about the advantages of the cloud: easy collaboration, scalability, ubiquity, sync, cost savings (21% on average, according to AFCOM 2011, 40% according to our own customers), rapid deployment, etc.
There is also no doubt about the need for a move to the cloud in healthcare: according to Enterprise Strategy Group, by 2015 an average of 665TB of data will be generated per hospital per year.</description>

    They are not, in principle, responsible for alien content they host, transmit, or give access to, but could incur in responsibility if they take an active participation in its ellaboration or, if knowing of a particular material being being illegal, do not act swiftly to take it down or prevent access to it.</description>

      <description>On April 25th I attended my first FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) Medical Device Establishment Inspection. Agent (Investigator) Kimberley A. Ricketts called me a couple days before to let me know that as a registered medical device manufacturing company, Kanteron Systems (the company I founded in 2005) had been selected for an Establishment Inspection. It was the &amp;ldquo;Notice of Inspection pursuant to Section 704(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act [21 U.</description>

Friday May 17th I took the day to meet some of the interesting tech companies present in New York. There are over 1,200 tech companies in NY(including CodeAcademy, KickStarter, Foursquare, MakerBot, ZocDoc, Guilt, AppNexus, Tumblr, Etsy, KickStarter, Automatic&amp;hellip; and mine!), most between the Flat Iron and SoHo areas of Manhattan (Silicon ALley). So I chose a few that, for one reason or another, I was interested in meeting and talk to their founders.</description>

      <description>If I go to the office, I complain that there are too many distractions: whether it is the boom-boom music form the downstairs SoHo store, my coworkers playing ping-pong, street art that requires my attention, or the temptation of a Japanese bento box or mochi with tea&amp;hellip;
But if I stay at home, Calvin makes sure I am not as productive as I could be.
OK, I admit it, this was a very silly excuse to try a new slider plugin with Pinterest non-official API&amp;hellip; and trying those things is not a diversion or distraction, is part of my job, I swear!</description>

      <description>After MIT`s crazy week, back in NY I needed a couple of days of sleep and relax to get back into the normal rhythm. Luckily it was SuperBowl weekend, so the streets (and Chelsea Market) were fairly empty!
So on Tuesday I was ready to get going full speed ahead. First, after meeting with P. Oberton in the NYPL, then I went to Condé Nast publications` building, into Wired Magazine, to discuss a PR campaign/project along with Valencia Regional Minister of Industry (&amp;amp; etc) Max Buch.</description>

      <description>The final day was an interesting one.
My team (team senZa) choose me to do the presentation of the teams project. We all thought we did an excellent job, and everybody in the room (372) congratulated us. One of the judges even said &amp;quot;it is the best one I have ever seen&amp;quot;. But... lo and behold, we were not selected to the final round. And whats even worst, we received almost no feedback.</description>

      <description>Day 5 started with a presentation of MIT`s eMBA and the REAP program.
After that, lectures by William Aulet, Scott Keating, Paul Maeder, and Antoinette Schoar.
And then&amp;hellip; an all-nighter preparing the group project. Tension, stress, frustration, but in the end a great feeling of accomplishment, and pride in a job well done.</description>

      <description>Day 4 started with a corporate presentation (we got to choose, and I attended the one by Pfizer) at 7:30am, in which Pfizer`s Senior Vice President of Research and Development talked about the rapidly shifting way in which big pharma is working, and mentioned an unacceptable fact that should make us all reflect on how much the patent system is broken:
 Pfizer has 98,000 employees&amp;hellip; and 31,000 lawyers!
 The rest of the day I attended classes by Catherine Tucker, Brian Halligan, and a speech by Dean David Schmittlein.</description>

Even during lunch (at room E52, 6th floor of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship – Tang Building) we are lectured. In this case by Scott Stern. Non stop from 7am until 8pm (or later, depending on how hard working your team is).</description>

Snowing, cold, snow, cold&amp;hellip;
Day 2 of the MIT-EDP program has been crazy. Breakfast at 7:00am, classes from 9:00am until 7:00pm, with a lunch break that was actually a lecture too, and two 15 minute breaks in which we were suppose to sign up for company visits, pick up material, etc&amp;hellip;
But it was worth it: William Aulet, and Fiona Murray are excellent lecturers with obviously a lot of experience.</description>

Today is my first day as a student of &amp;quot;the most important university in the world&amp;rdquo; (according to this article): MIT.
I am here to take the MIT Sloan Executive EducationEDP (Entrepreneurship Development Program).
Getting up at 4 am and braving the fluoutbreakin Boston and the cold weather including a frozen Charles River (not like it is less cold in NY anyway), I arrived from NY this morning in an early flight, and after checking in at the Marriot, I went to a luncheon at the Towne Stove and Spiritsrestaurant sponsored by Ken Morse.</description>

November 28th I flew to Chicago for the RSNA trade show.
I stayed at the very nice Public Hotel, attended the crazy big RSNA show, had dinner at Petterino‘s with Brazilian friends, and flew back to NY.</description>

      <description>The last week of my November trip to Spain, I went to Malaga for the MIT Technology Review Emtech Investors Forum event.
It was very sad and unfortunate that the mayor of Malaga did not listen to the organizers of the event, and stubbornly forced the event to be inaugurated November 22nd &amp;ldquo;becuase it was more convenient for him&amp;rdquo;. Since the main interest of the event were the US investors, they did not come because it was Thanksgiving.</description>

When you make the tools available to the people, and allow them to create (in this case under the safe harbor of &amp;ldquo;parody&amp;rdquo;) wonderful things happen. Its NOT all about the money, profit, control... Its about imagination, art, creativity, culture. Thats how it happens: copying, re-using, mixing, adjusting, modifying... thats what creativity is really about (or did you think it was about &amp;ldquo;inventing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;making unheard of things out of thin air&amp;rdquo;?</description>

      <description>After playing with it for a while, beyond it limitations (light, format, movement&amp;hellip;) here are the two biggest pitfalls with the Lytro camera:
  It is still for Mac OSX only. They NEED to come out with Open Source / Free Software (both their software AND platform support for GNU/Linux).
  Picture library size and location. BIG unresolved issue.

      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post, at IBM Innovation Center in Chicago they have a Watson(more info here) interactive kiosk with which to play an interactive game of Jeopardy. In case you have been living in a cave for the past few months, Watson beatJeopardy human champions on live TV, the significanceof which can not be overstated.
Now, remember: this is a &amp;ldquo;small version&amp;rdquo; of Watson, and a &amp;ldquo;self-contained&amp;rdquo; version of Jeopardy.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I received my new Lytrocamera. Although it is an incredible technology, and allows things that were unthinkable until now, so far I am mixed.
Pros:
 Compact and discreet Extremely easy to use New ways of taking pictures Novelty Supercool &amp;ldquo;focus later&amp;rdquo;  Cons:
 You have to get used to a different way of thinking and framing a shot (square! and distance) Low performance under low light (although better than my crappy Samsung Galaxy IIS camera)  Check out this online gallery.</description>

      <description>Technology is getting easier to use everyday. Take GNU/Linux distributions as an example: anyone can make their own. Does that mean everyone should make their own? Why not? But then, again, we end up with things like Ubuntu Satanic(and their Ubuntu SE 666.10 “Necrophiliac Neuromancer”), Hannah Montana Linux(how far would you go to attract kids to free software?), or Red Star OS(free software for North Korea and non-free browsing?

      <description>On Friday, at lunch time, I went to the Guggenheim to meet Susan Thompson, Curatorial Assistant, for a tour of Francesca Woodman exhibition.
Although Francesca Woodman`s photographs are undeniably subtle and portray the mind of a troubled young woman (body, space, self, disgust, identity, etc), it is a pity she took her life so early, leaving us with what is obviously a truncated body of work, one that begins, explores, promises&amp;hellip; but never concludes because death found her first.</description>

      <description>On Tuesday I went to New York University for a nice conversation in the Inside the Internet Garageseries, with journalists Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher (AllThingsDigital, Wall Street Journal, etc).
Besides the very interesting bio/background overview of them that the interviewer did, here are some quotes that caught my attention.
Walt Mossberg:
 IT departments are the most regressive force in tech, blocking new tech adoption
The story goes that Larry Page asked Steve Jobs for advice, he said &amp;ldquo;Find the 5 things you do best, and focus on it&amp;rdquo;, which its what hes doing</description>

      <description>After posting graphs and cold data (quite ilustrative, I believe), and the discussion it has generated (people, why don`t you use the &amp;ldquo;comment&amp;rdquo; instead all the other unstructured methods you are using?), please let me write a caveat about graphs and cold data.
In my high-tech gym, you have the option to have a lot of data collected, for your own, private and personal use. It seems like a great idea at first.</description>

      <description>While I am preparing a loooooong post about technology and privacy (with a provocative twist, for a change 😈 ), I have decided to play with face.com‘s face recognition technology.
What do you think? On target (hint: no, not on target, I am not THAT old, and definitely I AM a male)? Scary (hint: only if we are unaware of these technologies and their uses)?&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Over 600,000 Macs are infected with the FlashBack Trojan. Is yours one of those? Let`s find out.
Open the Terminal (c`mon, be a hacker, not a slacker) and type:
if it says:
 The domain/default pair of (/Applications/Safari.app/Contents/Info, LSEnvironment) does not exist
 that means your Mac is ok so far (otherwise, go here). Then type:

      <description>After wasting hours trying to double space or insert extra line breaks when writing a new post or page in WordPress only to see that WordPress automatically filters the content to remove those extra spaces once you click the “Publish” button, I have found the solution (not as obvious and not readily available in support forums) by using the TinyMCE Advanced plugin, which adds additional functionality to the default WordPress editor, including the ability to stop WordPress from automatically stripping out “p” (paragraph) and “br” (line break) tags.</description>

      <description>Last Saturday I went to the ArtHack Exhibitclosing party at 319 ScholesSt, Brooklyn (New York).
Located in an industrial complex in Brooklyn, at night, loooong two blocks from the subway, graffiti all over, small door&amp;hellip; that gave way to heaven: young (I was the oldest hacker in that space, but I did not feel that way) energetic happy people tinkering with technology and proudly showing their &amp;ldquo;toys&amp;rdquo; (hacks, mashups, creations, or whatever).</description>

      <description>Thanks to Sara, there is a very easy way to add code to your site to protest against SOPA:
Drop the following code in between your two tags on your site, your users will be redirected to the blackout page that describes what you are doing and why.
`Then, when the protest is over, simply remove the added code. The protest is starting at 12am on 1/18, and lasts 24 hours.</description>

      <description>In Spain we have a legal right called &amp;ldquo;private copy&amp;rdquo; by which anyone can make a copy (for non-commercial use) of their copyrighted content (movies, music, books, etc). To offset the supposed loss (many studies prove this &amp;ldquo;loss&amp;rdquo; to be a fallacy) we Spaniards pay the so-called &amp;ldquo;Digital canon&amp;rdquo;, a tax levied on blank media (CDs, HardDisks, printers, photocopiers, etc, etc) and managed by private monopolistic institutions called &amp;ldquo;collecting societies&amp;rdquo;, some run by supposed alcohol-consuming, whore-user, money-embezzler, tax-evading criminals (or so goes the accusations brought to a number of them by the Attorney General).</description>

      <description>Everyday 156,000 people die in the world. Yesterday a Mexican flower seller died from shot wounds, a Chinese mother died giving birth, a Turkish photographer died, a kid soldier was killed in Uganda, a Japanese widower died in love, and an American computer entrepreneur died, amongst others.
Keep thinking different.</description>
